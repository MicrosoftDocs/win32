# Contributing to Win32 Conceptual Documentation

Thank you for your interest in the Win32 documentation! We appreciate your feedback, edits, and additions to our docs.

## Writing content

Our documentation is written in Markdown, a lightweight text style syntax. If you're not familiar with Markdown, you can [learn the basics on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). When unsure, you can always copy the formatting style from other pages in our docs.

### Editing a file

You can find guidance on using this repo in the [Windows Authoring Guide](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/windows-authoring-guide/?branch=main). Documentation on upcoming features must be contributed via the private repository only. You **must** make sure you are contributing to the correct branch. 

You may clone this repository locally and make edits on your own machine, or you can use the GitHub interface to make edits. Cloning is a better option for large changes. In-browser editing works well for small fixes. Make sure you do so in a new personal branch. When you are ready to submit your edits, create a PR here on the GitHub page.

### Pull requests

When creating a pull request in the internal repo, make sure you're merging your personal branch into the branch it was created from.

After you submit your pull request, it is evaluated against a [content quality checklist](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/help/contribute/contribute-how-to-write-pull-request-quality-criteria?branch=main) to ensure it meets our basic standards. If it passes, it is assigned to a member of the UWP documentation team for further review. If it fails, you'll be told what changes to make.

The assigned reviewer(s) may approve or reject the PR, or work with you to make further changes. Reviewers will not merge the PR until you have approved it yourself.
