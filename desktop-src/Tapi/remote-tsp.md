# Remote TSP

The Remote TSP (Remotesp.tsp) provides access to communications resources not local to the current computer, such as a PBX. When the Remote TSP is configured to point to a given server, resources appear to a local application as if they existed on the user's computer.

Tcmsetup is a command-line utility that enables configuration of a Remote TSP. For more information about this utility, see Windows Help or the Windows Resource Kit.

The Remote TSP is installed with Windows Server 2003 operating systems, Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows NT, Windows Me, Windows 98, and Windows 95 operating systems.
