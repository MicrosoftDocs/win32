# ITStream (MSPI)

The [**ITStream**](/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itstream) interface is available if an MSP is associated with the call. The methods of this interface allow an application to retrieve information on a stream; to start, pause, or stop the stream; and to select or unselect terminals on a stream.

The [**ITStream**](/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itstream) interface is implemented by an MSP. Please see **ITStream** in the MSP Interface section for details on this interface.
