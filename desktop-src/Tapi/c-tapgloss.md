<span id="tapi2.call_redirection_tapgloss"></span><span id="TAPI2.CALL_REDIRECTION_TAPGLOSS"></span>**call redirection**
</dt> <dd>

A function that allows an application to deflect an offering call to another address without first answering the call. Call redirection differs from call forwarding in that call forwarding is performed by the switch without the involvement of the application; redirection can be done on a call-by-call basis by the application, for example, driven by caller ID information. It differs from call transfer in that transferring a call requires that the call first be answered. See *called-ID*, *caller-ID*, [*redirecting ID*](r-tapgloss.md), [*redirection ID*](r-tapgloss.md).
