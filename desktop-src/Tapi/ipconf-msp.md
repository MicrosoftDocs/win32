# IPConf MSP

\[IPConf MSP is not available for use in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and subsequent versions of the operating system. The RTC Client API provides similar functionality.\]

The IPConf MSP (Confmsp.dll), when paired with its TSP (IPconf.tsp), provides conferencing access to Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the Internet and many corporate intranets. In addition to the standard MSPI methods, this MSP exposes interfaces that allow control over individual participants in a conference.

Please see [IPConf MSP Interfaces](ipconf-msp-interfaces.md) for a summary of provider-specific interfaces exposed by this MSP.

The IPConf MSP has been enhanced in Windows 2000 SP1 to enable communication between H323 and SDP clients. It now additionally exposes the [**IMulticastControl**](imulticastcontrol.md) interface.

The IPConf MSP is installed with Windows 2000.
