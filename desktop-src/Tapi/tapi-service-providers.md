# TAPI Service Providers

TAPI service providers are an abstraction layer between TAPI applications and the underlying hardware and transport protocols. A [telephony service provider](telephony-service-providers-start-page.md) (TSP) supplies call controls and a [media service provider](./media-service-providers-start-page.md) (MSP) supplies detailed control over the media of a call. A TSP/MSP pair can implement the capabilities needed for applications ranging from basic telephony to IP multicast multimedia conferencing.
