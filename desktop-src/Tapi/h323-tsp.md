# H323 TSP

\[H323 TSP is not available for use in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and subsequent versions of the operating system. The RTC Client API provides similar functionality.\]

The H323 TSP (H323.tsp), when paired with the [H323 MSP](./h323-msp.md) (H323msp.dll), allows an application to make and receive video and audio calls using the H.323 protocol for IP telephony.

This TSP supports [**address type**](./lineaddresstype--constants.md) values of LINEADDRESSTYPE\_PHONENUMBER, LINEADDRESSTYPE\_IPADDRESS, and LINEADDRESSTYPE\_DOMAINNAME. The LINEADDRESSTYPE\_DOMAINNAME refers to the domain name of the machine.

The H323 MSP was enhanced in Windows 2000 SP1 to enable communication between H323 and SDP clients.

The H323 TSP is installed with Windows 2000 and later.
