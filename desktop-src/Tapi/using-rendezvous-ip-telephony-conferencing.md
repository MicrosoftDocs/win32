# Using Rendezvous IP Telephony Conferencing

\[ Rendezvous IP Telephony Conferencing controls and interfaces are not available for use in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and subsequent versions of the operating system. The RTC Client API provides similar functionality.\]

Rendezvous consists of three basic sets of interfaces:

-   [Directory controls](directory-controls.md) provide a means of discovering, creating, or modifying the conference and user information on an ILS or NTDS server.
-   [Conference blob controls](conference-blob-controls.md) allow provider-specific modifications to a conference.
-   [Multicast COM interfaces](multicast-com-interfaces.md) provide a means of reserving addresses for use by multicast conferences.
