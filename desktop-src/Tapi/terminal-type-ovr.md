# Terminal Type

The **terminal type** identifies whether a terminal is static or dynamic. For example, a modem is a static terminal while the video window on a computer screen gets created when it is needed and destroyed when its usefulness is over.

This concept is primarily used by TAPI 3 applications.

**TAPI 3.x:** See [**ITTerminal::get\_TerminalType**](/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itterminal-get_terminaltype), [**TERMINAL\_TYPE**](/windows/desktop/api/Tapi3if/ne-tapi3if-terminal_type).
