# Raw Channel Access MSP

The Raw Channel Access MSP (Rcsmsp.dll) does streaming via ksproxy to RCA, which allows streaming over connection-oriented Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) devices such as ATM and ISDN cards. The RCA MSP is created by the ndptsp, which is the TSP provided for NDIS WAN adapters. With the Windows 2000 release, only audio streaming is implemented.

The Raw Channel Access MSP is installed with Windows 2000.
