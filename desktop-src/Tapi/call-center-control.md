# Call Center Control

Basic TAPI 2.2 can be used to manage call centers and other elements of Telephony network infrastructure (such as IVR and voice mail servers) through third-party call control. To help create ACD proxies that will run on servers, functions have been added to TAPI 2.2 to provide additional assistance to application developers.

The following topics describe the TAPI 2.2 features that you can use to implement call center controls:

-   [Modeling of a Call Center](modeling-of-a-call-center.md)
-   [Stations](stations.md)
-   [Predictive Dialing](predictive-dialing.md)
-   [Call Queues and Route Points](call-queues-and-route-points.md)
-   [ACD Agent Monitoring and Control](acd-agent-monitoring-and-control.md)
-   [Station Status Control](station-status-control.md)
-   [Station Status Control](station-status-control.md)
-   [Call State Timer](call-state-timer.md)
-   [Media Event Timers](media-event-timers.md)

TAPI 3.x is the preferred API of writing ACD Agent applications. Please see the [Call Center Controls](./about-call-center-controls.md) section for information on using these interfaces and methods. However, TAPI 2.2 remains usable for full ACD application suites if desired.
