# TAPI 3.1 Requirements

The following are the operating system requirements for TAPI 3.x:

-   TAPI version 3.0 requires Windows 2000 or later.
-   TAPI version 3.1 requires Windows Server 2003 operating systems or Windows XP.

Note that the [IP Conferencing control](about-rendezvous-ip-telephony-conferencing.md) using Rendezvous requires access to at least one ILS or NTDS server. If an NTDS server is in place, it can be used to locate an ILS server. If no NTDS server exists, the end user must know the name of the ILS server.
