# ITTerminalSupport (MSPI)

The [**ITTerminalSupport**](/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itterminalsupport) interface is exposed on an [Address object](address-object.md) if an MSP exists. The methods of this interface allow an application to discover available terminals and/or create one, and get pointers to required [Terminal objects](terminal-object.md).

The [**ITTerminalSupport**](/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itterminalsupport) interface is implemented by an MSP and is not available if there is no media service provider associated with the address. Please see **ITTerminalSupport** in the MSP Interface section for details on this interface.
