# Creating a Conference Announcement

\[ Rendezvous IP Telephony Conferencing controls and interfaces are not available for use in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and subsequent versions of the operating system. The RTC Client API provides similar functionality.\]

The following code fragment illustrates the creation of a simple conference announcement. This fragment assumes that [connecting to an ILS server](connecting-to-an-ils-server.md) has already been performed.


```C++
// If ( hr != S_OK ) process the error here. 
```
