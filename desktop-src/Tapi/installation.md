# Installation (Telephony API)

The primary sources for installation procedures are the Resource Kit for the target operating system, application documentation, and service provider instructions. For Microsoft service providers, the appropriate resource kit contains instructions.

The installation process must include listing "Telephony Service" as dependency.

If an application or service provider uses the registry for storage of persistent private data, the information must not be placed in TAPI's section of the registry. The format of this section is not guaranteed to be maintained in future versions.
