# Pluggable Terminals

Pluggable terminals allow an application to create terminals during run time. Terminals are normally created and controlled by a telephony service provider/media service provider (TSP/MSP) pair, and this remains the most versatile and stable means of manipulating terminals. However, some applications need to use simple terminals in situations where an appropriate TSP/MSP pair is not available. Only application writers who are thoroughly familiar with TSP/MSP operations should use pluggable terminals.

In TAPI version 3.1, pluggable terminals are added to the TAPI model. Pluggable terminals allow a third party to add a new terminal object that any MSP can use.

See [Pluggable Terminal Registration](pluggable-terminal-registration.md) and [Writing a Pluggable Terminal](writing-a-pluggable-terminal.md) for more information.
