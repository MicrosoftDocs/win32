# IPConf TSP

\[IPConf TSP is not available for use in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and subsequent versions of the operating system. The RTC Client API provides similar functionality.\]

The IPConf TSP (Ipconf.tsp), when paired with the [IPConf MSP](./ipconf-msp.md) (Confmsp.dll), provides conferencing access to Internet Protocol networks, such as the Internet and many corporate intranets.

This TSP supports an [**address type**](./lineaddresstype--constants.md) value of LINEADDRESSTYPE\_SDP.

The IPConf MSP was enhanced in Windows 2000 SP1 to enable communication between H323 and SDP clients.

The IPConf TSP is installed with Windows 2000 and later.
