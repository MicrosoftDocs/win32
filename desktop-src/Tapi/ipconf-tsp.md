\[IPConf TSP is not available for use in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and subsequent versions of the operating system. The RTC Client API provides similar functionality.\]

This TSP supports an [**address type**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733291(v=VS.85).aspx) value of LINEADDRESSTYPE\_SDP.

The IPConf MSP was enhanced in Windows 2000 SP1 to enable communication between H323 and SDP clients.
