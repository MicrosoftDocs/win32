# TAPI 2.2 Overview

The Microsoft Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) version 2.2 is a C-based interface that allows developers to implement a range of communications applications. The following material presents overview information specific to using TAPI 2.2. Primary overview material is contained in [Microsoft Telephony Programming Model](./microsoft-telephony-programming-model.md). Familiarity with this material is assumed.

-   [TAPI Versioning](tapi-versioning.md) covers the available versions of TAPI, how they are distributed, and how your application can negotiate the version of TAPI to be used..
-   [Session Access](session-access.md) covers some call session material specific to TAPI 2.2 (TAPI/C). See the general overview on [Session Control](./session-control.md) for primary reference on call session operations and information.
-   [Device Access](device-access.md) covers capabilities specific to TAPI 2.2 (TAPI/C). See the general overview on [Device Control](./device-control.md) for primary reference on device information and operations.
-   [Media Access](media-access.md) covers material on the media information and controls available to a TAPI 2.2 application. The media service providers give you access to more detailed controls, but only TAPI 3 (TAPI/COM) applications can use their capabilities. See [About the Media Service Provider](./about-the-media-service-provider-msp-.md) for additional information.
-   [Call Center Control](call-center-control.md) covers material on building Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) applications using TAPI 2.2. For TAPI 3.x, see [Call Center Controls](./about-call-center-controls.md).
-   [Phone Devices](phone-devices.md) covers the supplementary phone device controls supplied by TAPI 2.2 (TAPI/C).
