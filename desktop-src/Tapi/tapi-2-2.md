# TAPI 2.2

TAPI 2.2 provides specialized call center management functionality. Under TAPI 2.1 and earlier, call center software required careful mapping of lines and addresses to call center function. The TAPI 2.1 functions coordinate with TAPI 3.x call center capabilities and makes the creation of ACD systems much easier.

**TAPI 2.x:** For more information, see [Call Center Control](call-center-control.md).

**TAPI 3.x:** For more information, see [Call Center Controls](./about-call-center-controls.md).
