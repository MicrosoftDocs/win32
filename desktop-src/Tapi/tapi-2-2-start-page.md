# Telephony Application Programming Interface Version 2.2

## Purpose

The Microsoft Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) version 2.2 (TAPI/C) enables implementation of communications applications ranging from basic modem control to call centers with multiple agents and switches.

## Where applicable

Possible TAPI 2.2 applications include:

-   Basic voice calls on the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
-   Call center applications for tracking multiple agents
-   Modem control
-   PBX control
-   Interactive voice response (IVR) systems
-   Voice mail
-   Detailed phone device control

## Developer audience

TAPI/C is designed for use by C/C++ programmers. Development experience with telecommunications or other telephony applications is helpful, but not necessary.

## Run-time requirements

TAPI version 2.2 enables development of communications applications for the Windows Server 2003 operating systems, Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows NT, Windows Me, Windows 98, and Windows 95. For more information about which operating systems support a particular function, see the Requirements section of the documentation for that function.
