# H323 MSP

\[H323 MSP is not available for use in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and subsequent versions of the operating system. The RTC Client API provides similar functionality.\]

The H323 MSP (H323msp.dll), when paired with its TSP (H323.tsp), allows an application to make and receive video and audio calls using the H.323 protocol for IP telephony.

The H323 MSP has been enhanced in Windows 2000 SP1 to enable communication between H323 and SDP clients. It now exposes the [**IH323LineEx**](ih323lineex.md) and [**IKeyFrameControl**](ikeyframecontrol.md) interfaces.

The H323 MSP is installed with Windows 2000.
