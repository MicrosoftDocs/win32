# Extended Telephony Phone Functions

The Extended phone services (or Device-Specific phone services) include all extensions to the TAPI defined by the service provider. TAPI defines a mechanism that enables service-provider vendors to extend TAPI using device-specific extensions. TAPI defines only the extension mechanism, and by doing so provides access to device-specific extensions. TAPI does not define their behavior, which is completely defined by the service provider.

TAPI consists of scalar and bit-flag data constant definitions, data structures, functions, and messages. Procedures are defined that enable a vendor to extend most of these, as described in the following topics.

-   [Scalar Data Constants](scalar-data-constants.md)
-   [Bit-Flag Data Constants](bit-flag-data-constants.md)
-   [Functions and Messages](functions-and-messages.md)
