# CMSPStream Type Definitions

The following definitions provide a set of stream states that may be useful to the derived class, although their use is not required. Derived classes can conveniently extend the set of available states simply by defining additional values.

``` syntax
#define STRM_INITIAL            0x00000000
#define STRM_TERMINALSELECTED   0x00000001
#define STRM_CONFIGURED         0x00000002
#define STRM_RUNNING            0x00000004
#define STRM_PAUSED             0x00000008
#define STRM_STOPPED            0x00000010
```
