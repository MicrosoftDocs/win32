# TAPI Object

The TAPI object represents all telephony resources to which the local computer has access, allowing an application to enumerate all local and remote addresses. A TAPI 3 application must create an instance of the TAPI object and then initialize it.

The [Initialize TAPI](initialize-tapi.md) code example shows an example of TAPI object creation.

See [TAPI Object Interfaces](tapi-object-interfaces.md) for a list of all interfaces associated with the TAPI object.
