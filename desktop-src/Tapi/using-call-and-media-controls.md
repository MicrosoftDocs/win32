# Using Call And Media Controls

The following material provides assistance in using TAPI 3 call controls:

-   [Using File Terminals](using-file-terminals.md)
-   [Using Multitrack Terminals and the Default Selection Mechanism](using-multitrack-terminals-and-the-default-selection-mechanism.md)
-   [Pluggable Terminal Registration](pluggable-terminal-registration.md)

For a diagram of all objects and interfaces, see [About Call And Media Controls](about-call-and-media-controls.md). For reference lists by functional area, see [Call and Media Controls Quick Reference](call-and-media-controls-quick-reference.md).

Developers interested in writing IP multicast conferencing applications should consult [About Rendezvous IP Telephony Conferencing](about-rendezvous-ip-telephony-conferencing.md).

[Libraries required](libraries-required.md)

A list of LIB files needed to compile various TAPI 3 applications, as of 3/1/99.

[Hints and Tips](hints-and-tips.md)

Some pitfalls to avoid.

Code Samples

In the Code Samples section of the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) under NetDS are sample TAPI programs in C++, Visual Basic, and Java. You can locate them by searching on "INCOMING Sample Application" or "OUTGOING Sample Application".

[Code Examples](tapi-quick-start.md)

The code examples briefly illustrate some basic operations, such as initializing TAPI and making a simple call.
