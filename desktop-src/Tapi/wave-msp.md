# Wave MSP

The Wave MSP (Wavemsp.dll) fits legacy TSPs written prior to the introduction of MSPs into TAPI 3's MSP-based streaming architecture. Some of the legacy TSPs expose wave device identifiers, which were a means for the application to control streaming under TAPI 2.1. Tapi3.dll uses the Wave MSP for any TSP that does not have its own MSP but that has a wave device.

The Wave MSP is installed with Windows 2000.
