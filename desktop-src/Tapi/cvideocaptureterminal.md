# CVideoCaptureTerminal

The **CVideoCaptureTerminal** terminal is derived from [CSingleFilterTerminal](csinglefilterterminal.md) and implements a static video capture terminal using a single DirectShow filter. It does not support certain advanced video capture interfaces that are applicable only to WDM video capture. Most MSPs will not need to override the implementation of this terminal.

Defined in MSPtmvc.h.
