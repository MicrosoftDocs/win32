# File Terminals

In TAPI 3.1, the terminal object is expanded to include a file terminal. File terminals provide a simple means to perform common operations, for example, recording an audio stream or streams to a file or subsequent playback of recorded audio to a stream.

Five basic objects are used to manipulate file terminals:

-   File Playback Terminal
-   File Recording Terminal
-   File Playback Track
-   File Recording Track
-   File Event

The File Terminal objects can be thought of as an abstraction for the storage, which is usually a file. Tracks correspond to the individual audio data streams in that storage, such as when voice is recorded.

For more information about file terminals, see:

-   [File Playback Terminal and File Recording Terminal](file-playback-terminal-and-file-recording-terminal.md)
-   [Track Terminals](track-terminals.md)

For more information and code samples and task lists related to file terminals, see [Using File Terminals](using-file-terminals.md).
