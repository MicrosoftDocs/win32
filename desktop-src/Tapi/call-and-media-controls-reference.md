# Call and Media Controls Reference

The Call and Media Control reference material contains information on interfaces, methods, enumerators, and types used in call setup and control.

You may also wish to search the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) for information on DirectShow and the Component Object Model (COM). TAPI 3.x uses DirectShow filters and filter managers to control the media stream following connection setup. COM is the basic coding model for TAPI 3.x, and familiarity with it is assumed throughout this document.
