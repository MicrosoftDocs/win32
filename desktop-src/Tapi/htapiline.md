# HTAPILINE

The **HTAPILINE** datatype represents the TAPI opaque handle for a line data structure. TAPI must resolve a value of this type into a reference to the appropriate data structure instance. The service provider must not attempt to reference through this as if it were a pointer, make assumptions about its values, or interpret its representation in any way other than passing its value to TAPI at appropriate times.
