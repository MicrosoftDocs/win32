# Telephony Application Programming Interfaces

The Microsoft telephony application programming interfaces support the development of communications applications for Microsoft Windows. The telephony interfaces are listed in the following table.



| Interface                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| [TAPI 2.x](./tapi-2-2-start-page.md)               | A C-programming language based API that enables you to implement communications applications ranging from basic modem control to call centers with multiple agents and switches.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [TAPI 3.x](tapi-3-1-start-page.md)                        | A COM-based API that merges classic and IP telephony.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [TSPI](./telephony-service-providers-start-page.md) | A telephony service provider (TSP) is a dynamic-link library (DLL) that supports communications device control through a set of exported service functions. A TAPI application uses standardized commands, TAPI passes information to the telephony service provider, and the TSP handles the specific commands that must be exchanged with the device. |
| [MSPI](media-service-providers-start-page.md)             | A media service provider (MSP) allows an application considerable control over the media for a particular transport mechanism. An MSP is always paired with a telephony service provider (TSP).                                                                                                                                                         |
