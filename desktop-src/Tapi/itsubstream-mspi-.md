# ITSubStream (MSPI)

The [**ITSubStream**](/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itsubstream) interface is available if an MSP is associated with the call and it implements substreams. The methods of this interface allow an application to retrieve information on a substream; to start, pause, or stop the substream; and to select or unselect terminals on a substream.

The [**ITSubStream**](/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itsubstream) interface is implemented by an MSP. Please see **ITSubStream** in the MSP Interface section for details on this interface.
