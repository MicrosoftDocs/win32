<span id="tapi2.integrated_services_digital_network_isdn__tapgloss"></span><span id="TAPI2.INTEGRATED_SERVICES_DIGITAL_NETWORK_ISDN__TAPGLOSS"></span>**Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)**
</dt> <dd>

A completely digital telephone/telecommunications network for carrying voice, data, images, and video at high speed by sending digitally encoded signals at speeds of up to 144,000 bps on Basic Rate Interface (BRI-ISDN) lines and much higher on Primary Rate Interface (PRI-ISDN) lines. ISDN is composed of at least three channels and as many as 32 channels, for simultaneous, independently operated transmission of voice and data. See [*Basic Rate Interface (BRI-ISDN)*](b-tapgloss.md), [*Primary Rate Interface (PRI-ISDN)*](p-tapgloss.md).

</dt> <dd>

A telephony application that leads a telephone caller through a hierarchy of menus, delivers voice responses, collects voice and data inputs, and performs other operations on behalf of the caller or the program sponsor. See [*Web Telephony*](w-tapgloss.md).

<span id="tapi2.inverse_multiplexing_tapgloss"></span><span id="TAPI2.INVERSE_MULTIPLEXING_TAPGLOSS"></span>**inverse multiplexing**
</dt> <dd>

The process whereby bandwidth enables a call to transmit more information at the same time in the same timeframe than information from a single signal transmitted over a single channel. This is accomplished by splitting a single high-speed channel into multiple signals, transmitting the multiple signals over multiple facilities operating at a lower rate than the original signal, and then recombining the separately transmitted portions into the original signal at the original rate. See [*bandwidth*](b-tapgloss.md).

<span id="tapi2.ip_multicast_tapgloss"></span><span id="TAPI2.IP_MULTICAST_TAPGLOSS"></span>**IP Multicast**
</dt> <dd>

IP multicast is a scheme for sending the same data to several machines simultaneously. A network with multicast-aware routers enabled will be able to convey such information much more rapidly by sending packets just once between routers. For additional information, see [About Rendezvous IP Telephony Conferencing](./about-rendezvous-ip-telephony-conferencing.md).
