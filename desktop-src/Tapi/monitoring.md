# Monitoring

Monitoring is a service-provider defined feature that detects signals that indicate other media. For example, one application can be playing an outgoing "leave a message" voice message while the incoming call starts sending a fax "calling" tone and waits for a handshake. In order not to lose the fax call, the local application monitors for this tone while playing the voice message.

Monitoring comprises [media monitoring](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms725242(v=vs.85)), [digit monitoring](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms725185(v=vs.85)), and [tone monitoring](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms725520(v=vs.85)).
