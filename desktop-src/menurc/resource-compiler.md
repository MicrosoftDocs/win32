# Resource Compiler

The Microsoft Windows Resource Compiler (RC) is a tool used in building Windows-based applications. This overview describes how to create a resource-definition (script) file, how to compile your application's resources, and how to add compiled resources to your application.

This tool is available in Visual Studio and the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).

Note! Although the RC is obtained by downloading [Windows App SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), responsibility for the design of emerging UI controls befalls the Windows OS team. Maintenance and migration of the legacy RC tool suite befalls the Windows App SDK team, who are defining a merge path for legacy RC control tools and emerging modern Fluent UI frameworks. [Unified API surface across desktop app platforms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/#benefits-of-the-windows-app-sdk-for-windows-developers) and [Consistent experience across Windows versions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/#benefits-of-the-windows-app-sdk-for-windows-developers) describe their merge path promise. 
 

The following topics describe the resource file syntax and the RC command line:
