# Carets

A *caret* is a blinking line, block, or bitmap in the client area of a window. The caret typically indicates the place at which text or graphics will be inserted.

The following illustration shows some common variations in the appearance of the caret.

Applications can create a caret, change its blink time, and display, hide, or relocate the caret.

| [**CreateCaret**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-createcaret)             | Creates a new shape for the system caret and assigns ownership of the caret to the specified window. The caret shape can be a line, a block, or a bitmap. <br/>                                                                                         |
| [**DestroyCaret**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-destroycaret)           | Destroys the caret's current shape, frees the caret from the window, and removes the caret from the screen. <br/>                                                                                                                                       |
| [**GetCaretBlinkTime**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-getcaretblinktime) | Retrieves the time required to invert the caret's pixels. The user can set this value. <br/>                                                                                                                                                            |
| [**GetCaretPos**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-getcaretpos)             | Copies the caret's position to the specified [**POINT**](/previous-versions//dd162805(v=vs.85)) structure. <br/>                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [**HideCaret**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-hidecaret)                 | Removes the caret from the screen. Hiding a caret does not destroy its current shape or invalidate the insertion point. <br/>                                                                                                                           |
| [**SetCaretBlinkTime**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-setcaretblinktime) | Sets the caret blink time to the specified number of milliseconds. The blink time is the elapsed time, in milliseconds, required to invert the caret's pixels. <br/>                                                                                    |
| [**SetCaretPos**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-setcaretpos)             | Moves the caret to the specified coordinates. If the window that owns the caret was created with the **CS\_OWNDC** class style, then the specified coordinates are subject to the mapping mode of the device context associated with that window. <br/> |
| [**ShowCaret**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-showcaret)                 | Makes the caret visible on the screen at the caret's current position. When the caret becomes visible, it begins flashing automatically. <br/>                                                                                                          |
