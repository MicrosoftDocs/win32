# Displaying Progress Messages

By default, RC compiles without displaying progress messages. However, you can specify that RC is to display progress messages. To do so, use the **/v** option.

The following example causes RC to report its progress as it compiles the resource-definition file Sample.rc and creates the compiled resource file Sample.res:

**rc /v sample.rc**
