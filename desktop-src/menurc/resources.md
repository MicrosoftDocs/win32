# Menus and Other Resources

A *resource* is binary data that you can add to the executable file of a Windows-based application. A resource can be either standard or defined. The data in a *standard resource* describes an icon, cursor, menu, dialog box, bitmap, enhanced metafile, font, accelerator table, message-table entry, string-table entry, or version information. An *application-defined resource*, also called a *custom resource*, contains any data required by a specific application.
