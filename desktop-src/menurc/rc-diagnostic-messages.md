# RC Diagnostic Messages

This section describes of diagnostic messages produced by RC. Many of these messages appear when RC is not able to compile resources properly. The descriptions clarify the cause of each message.

A capital V in parentheses (V) at the beginning of a message description indicates that the message is displayed only if RC is run with the **/v** (verbose) option. These messages are generally informative and do not necessarily indicate errors.

The messages are listed in alphabetic order in the following topics:

[A](a.md) [B](b.md) [C](c.md) [E](e.md) [F](f.md) [I](i.md) [N](n.md) [O](o.md) [R](r.md) [T](t.md) [U](u.md) [V](v.md) [W](w.md)
