## Work with C++

If you're an old hand with C++ on Windows platforms, things may look a little different. Here are some pointers to topics that can help you get a handle on the difference.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of these topics exist to help you maintain your C++/CX application. But we recommend that you use [C++/WinRT](/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/intro-to-using-cpp-with-winrt) for new applications. C++/WinRT is an entirely standard modern C++17 language projection for Windows Runtime (WinRT) APIs, implemented as a header-file-based library, and designed to provide you with first-class access to the modern Windows API.
