# XInput Game Controller APIs

> [!Important]
> [GameInput](/gaming/gdk/_content/gc/input/overviews/input-overview) is a functional superset of all legacy input APIs—XInput, DirectInput, Raw Input, Human Interface Device (HID), and WinRT—with new features that expose input devices of all kinds through a single consistent interface. It's available on all Windows platforms (including PC, Xbox, HoloLens, IoT), previous versions of Windows (all the way back to Windows 7), and is callable from GDK, Win32, and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications.

## Purpose

XInput Game Controller API enables applications to receive input from a controller.
