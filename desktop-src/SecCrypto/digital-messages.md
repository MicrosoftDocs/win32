# Digital Messages

A message will be defined as any data that has been encoded. Messages are data encoded for transmission to another person or entity or encoded data received from another person or entity. In the crypto environment, messages are usually signed, encrypted, or both. The term messages often includes certificates.

In CryptoAPI version 2.0, message handling functions are divided into [*low-level message functions*](../secgloss/l-gly.md) and [*simplified message functions*](../secgloss/s-gly.md).
