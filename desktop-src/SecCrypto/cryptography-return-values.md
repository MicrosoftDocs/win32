# Cryptography Return Values

The following return values are used by cryptography functions and defined in Wincrypt.h. Cryptography return values are categorized according to usage as follows.



| Return value                                                                       | Description                                                                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [ASN.1 Encoding/Decoding Return Values](asn-1-encoding-decoding-return-values.md) | Predefined constants that are returned by functions that do ASN.1 encoding or decoding.                    |
| [Certificate and Trust Return Values](certificate-and-trust-return-values.md)     | Predefined constants that are returned when the validity and trust status of a certificate are determined. |
