# Cryptography Tools

Cryptography tools provide command-line tools for code signing, signature verification, and other cryptography tasks.

## Introduction to Code Signing

The software industry must provide users with the means to trust code including code published on the Internet. Many webpages contain only static information that can be downloaded with little risk. Some pages, however, contain controls and applications to be downloaded and run on a user's computer. These executable files can be risky to download and run.

Packaged software uses branding and trusted sales outlets to assure users of its integrity, but these guarantees are not available when code is transmitted on the Internet. Additionally, the Internet itself cannot provide any guarantee about the identity of the software creator. Nor can it guarantee that any software downloaded was not altered after its creation. Browsers can exhibit a warning message that explains the possible dangers of downloading data of any kind, but browsers cannot verify that code is what it claims to be. A more active approach must be taken to make the Internet a reliable medium for distributing software.

One approach to providing guarantees of the authenticity and [*integrity*](../secgloss/i-gly.md) of files is attaching [*digital signatures*](../secgloss/d-gly.md) to those files. A digital signature attached to a file positively identifies the distributor of that file and ensures that the contents of the file were not changed after the signature was created.

Digital signatures can be created and verified by using Microsoft's cryptography APIs. For background information on cryptography and the [*CryptoAPI*](../secgloss/c-gly.md) functions, see [Cryptography Essentials](cryptography-essentials.md).

For detailed information on [*digital signatures*](../secgloss/d-gly.md), [*certificates*](../secgloss/c-gly.md), and [*certificate stores*](../secgloss/c-gly.md), see the following topics:

-   [Hashes and Digital Signatures](hashes-and-digital-signatures.md)
-   [Digital Certificates](digital-certificates.md)
-   [Managing Certificates with Certificate Stores](managing-certificates-with-certificate-stores.md)
-   [Certificate Trust Verification](certificate-trust-verification.md)

Currently, CryptoAPI Tools supports Microsoft Authenticode technology by allowing software vendors to sign the following types of files for Authenticode verification.
