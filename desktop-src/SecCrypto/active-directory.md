# Active Directory

Certificate Services supports the use of Active Directory. In the case of the enterprise [*certification authority*](../secgloss/c-gly.md) (CA), Certificate Services requires the use of the Active Directory. The enterprise CA publishes user certificates and [*certificate revocation lists*](../secgloss/c-gly.md) (CRL) to the Active Directory. A stand-alone CA can be administered to perform the same actions provided the Active Directory is available to the stand-alone CA and a custom policy module is used.
