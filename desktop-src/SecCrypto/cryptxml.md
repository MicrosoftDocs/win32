# CryptXML

CryptXML provides a low level set of native APIs that implement XML digital signature creation and verification based on the XML Signature Syntax and Processing (Second Edition) W3C recommendation. Developers need to be familiar with this standard to effectively use the CryptXML digital signature APIs.

CryptXML contains the following topics:

-   [XML Digital Signature Overview](xml-digital-signature-overview.md)
-   [XML Digital Signature API Functionality](xml-digital-signature-api-functionality.md)
-   [XML Digital Signature Cryptographic Algorithms](xml-digital-signature-cryptographic-algorithms.md)
-   [XML Digital Signature Cryptographic Extensions](xml-digital-signature-cryptographic-extensions.md)
-   [XML Digital Signature Security Considerations](xml-digital-signature-security-considerations.md)
