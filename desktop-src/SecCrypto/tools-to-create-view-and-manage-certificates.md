# Tools to Create, View, and Manage Certificates

CryptoAPI Tools are tools to perform common certificate management tasks.



| Tool                                | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [MakeCert](makecert.md)<br/> | Creates a test [*X.509*](../secgloss/x-gly.md) certificate.<br/>                                                                                |
| [Cert2SPC](cert2spc.md)<br/> | Creates a test [*Software Publisher Certificate*](../secgloss/s-gly.md) (SPC).<br/>           |
| [CertMgr](certmgr.md)<br/>   | Manages certificates, CTLs, and [*certificate revocation lists*](../secgloss/c-gly.md) (CRLs).<br/> |



 

All user input to these tools is case insensitive. Separate options now exist for the [*key pair*](../secgloss/k-gly.md) name and the [*private key*](../secgloss/p-gly.md) file.

## Additional Tools

Certutil.exe is a command-line tool that is installed as part of Certificate Services. You can use Certutil.exe to dump and display [*certification authority*](../secgloss/c-gly.md) (CA) configuration information, configure Certificate Services, back up and restore CA components, and verify [*certificates*](../secgloss/c-gly.md), [*key pairs*](../secgloss/k-gly.md), and certificate chains. For more information about Certutil, see the [Certutil](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/cc732443(v=ws.11)) topic on Microsoft TechNet.
