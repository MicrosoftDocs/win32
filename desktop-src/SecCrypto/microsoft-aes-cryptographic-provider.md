# Microsoft AES Cryptographic Provider

The Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider supports the same capabilities as the Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider, called the Base Provider. The AES Provider supports stronger security through longer keys and additional algorithms. It can be used with all versions of CryptoAPI.

**Windows XP:** The Microsoft AES Cryptographic Provider was named Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider (Prototype).

To maintain backward compatibility with earlier provider versions, the provider name, as defined in the Wincrypt.h header file, retains the version 1.0 designation even though newer versions of this provider have been shipped. To determine the version of the provider in use, call [**CryptGetProvParam**](/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptgetprovparam) with the *dwParam* parameter set to PP\_VERSION. Version 2.0 is in use if 0x0200 is returned.

The following table highlights differences between the Base Provider, Strong Provider, and AES Provider. The [*key lengths*](../secgloss/k-gly.md) shown are the default key lengths.

For a complete list of supported algorithms, see [AES Provider Algorithms](aes-provider-algorithms.md).

The Strong Provider, Enhanced Provider, and AES Provider are backward-compatible with the Base Provider except that the providers can generate only RC2 or RC4 keys of default key length. The default length for the Base Provider is 40 bits. The default length for the AES Provider is 128 bits. Thus the AES Provider cannot create keys with Base Provider-compatible key lengths. However, the AES Provider can import RC2 and RC4 keys of up to 128 bits. Therefore, the AES Provider can import and use 40-bit keys generated by using the Base Provider.
