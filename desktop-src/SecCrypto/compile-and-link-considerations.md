# Compile and Link Considerations

Compiling and linking the sample programs in this section involves consideration of the following areas:

-   [Required Libraries](required-libraries.md)
-   [Certificate and Message Encoding Types](certificate-and-message-encoding-types.md)
-   [\#includes and \#defines](-includes-and--defines.md)
-   [Error Handling](error-handling.md)
