# Tools to Sign Files and Check Signatures

CryptoAPI Tools are the following tools that you can use to sign files digitally, to confirm signatures on files, and to create catalog files.



| Tool                     | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [MakeCat](makecat.md)   | Makes an unsigned catalog file. This catalog file is subsequently used to compare the [*hashes*](../secgloss/h-gly.md) within the catalog file to the hashes of individual files, which helps prove that the original files are free of tampering. |
| [SetReg](setreg.md)     | Sets registry keys that control the certificate verification process.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [SignTool](signtool.md) | Digitally signs files and confirms digital signatures of files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
