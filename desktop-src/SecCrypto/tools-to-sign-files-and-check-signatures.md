| Tool                     | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [MakeCat](makecat.md)   | Makes an unsigned catalog file. This catalog file is subsequently used to compare the [*hashes*](security.h_gly#-security-hash-gly) within the catalog file to the hashes of individual files, which helps prove that the original files are free of tampering. |
| [SetReg](setreg.md)     | Sets registry keys that control the certificate verification process.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [SignTool](signtool.md) | Digitally signs files and confirms digital signatures of files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
