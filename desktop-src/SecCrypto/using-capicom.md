# Using CAPICOM

\[CAPICOM is a 32-bit only component that is available for use in the following operating systems: Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, and Windows XP. Instead, use the .NET Framework to implement security features. For more information, see [Alternatives to Using CAPICOM](alternatives-to-using-capicom.md).\]

This section includes scenarios that use CAPICOM procedures.

> [!Note]  
> Creating [*digital signatures*](../secgloss/d-gly.md) and un-enveloping messages with CAPICOM is done using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) cryptography and can only be done if the signer or user decrypting an enveloped message has access to a certificate with an available, associated private key. To decrypt an enveloped message, a certificate with access to the private key must be in the MY store.

 

Task-based scenarios discussions and examples have been separated into the following sections:
