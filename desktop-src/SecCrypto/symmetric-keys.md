# Symmetric Keys

A [*Symmetric key*](../secgloss/s-gly.md) is a single key that is used with the operations of a [*symmetric encryption*](../secgloss/s-gly.md) scheme. For example, such a key may be used in a symmetric encryption algorithm for both encryption and decryption.

The best-known symmetric algorithms are faster than the best-known [*public key algorithms*](../secgloss/p-gly.md). Thus, they are preferred when processing large amounts of data. Some of the more common symmetric algorithms are [*RC4*](../secgloss/r-gly.md), Triple DES ([*Data Encryption Standard*](../secgloss/d-gly.md)), and [*Advanced Encryption Standard*](../secgloss/a-gly.md) (AES).

Because much of the activity involving symmetric keys relates to keeping them secret, it is important to keep the number of people who possess a particular symmetric key as small as possible. We recommend that only one or two people possess any one symmetric key.
