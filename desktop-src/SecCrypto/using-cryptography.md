# Using Cryptography

The following topics provide information about using cryptography. These procedures and examples demonstrate CryptoAPI, CAPICOM, and Certificate Services tasks. The examples use cryptographic function calls, interfaces, and objects described in the [Cryptography Reference](cryptography-reference.md).
