# Using Certificate Enrollment Control

The Certificate Enrollment Control is a single object with many properties and several methods that can be used to determine how the Certificate Enrollment Control processes the user information, the type of certificate to be requested, how the keys are to be generated, where the certificate is to be stored, and related processes. There are two primary uses of the Certificate Enrollment Control: to create a [*certificate request*](../secgloss/c-gly.md) (PKCS \#10), and to receive the returned certificate and store it in a [*certificate store*](../secgloss/c-gly.md). For details and syntax for creating an instance of the Certificate Enrollment Control object, setting its properties, and using its methods, see the following topics.
