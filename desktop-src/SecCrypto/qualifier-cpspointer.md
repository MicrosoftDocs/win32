# Qualifier.CPSPointer property

\[The **CPSPointer** property is available for use in the operating systems specified in the Requirements section. Instead, use the [**X509Extension Class**](/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.x509certificates.x509extension) in the [**System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates**](/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.x509certificates.publickey.-ctor) namespace by calling the constructor that takes an OID as a parameter, and then use the OID for Certificate Policies to process qualifiers that are part of the policy information in the Certificate Policies extension.\]

The **CPSPointer** property retrieves the URI that points to a Certification Practice Statement (CPS) published by the certification authority (CA).
