# Signing Data and Verifying Digital Signatures

\[CAPICOM is a 32-bit only component that is available for use in the following operating systems: Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, and Windows XP. Instead, use the .NET Framework to implement security features. For more information, see [Alternatives to Using CAPICOM](alternatives-to-using-capicom.md).\]

Signing data and verification of signatures on data are among the most important tasks done with [*cryptography*](../secgloss/c-gly.md). The following sections show examples for digital signature tasks:

-   [Signing a Document](signing-a-document.md)
-   [Cosigning a Document](cosigning-a-document.md)
-   [Verifying the Signature on a Document](verifying-the-signature-on-a-document.md)
