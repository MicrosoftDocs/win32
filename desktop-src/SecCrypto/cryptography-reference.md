# Cryptography Reference

Cryptography reference pages contain detailed descriptions of the Microsoft cryptography functions, interfaces, objects, and other programming elements. These pages include reference descriptions of the API for working with digital certificates, certificate services, and certificate enrollment control.

Reference pages are divided into the following groups. 

| Section                                                      | Description                                                                                        |
