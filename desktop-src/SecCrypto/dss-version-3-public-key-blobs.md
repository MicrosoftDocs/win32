# DSS Version 3 Public Key BLOBs

DSS version 3 [*Public Key BLOBs*](../secgloss/p-gly.md) of type PUBLICKEYBLOB are used to export and import information about a DH public key. They have the following format:


```C++
BLOBHEADER blobheader; 
        // As explained under "Data Structures"
DSSPUBKEY_VER3 dsspubkeyver3;
BYTE p[dsspubkeyver3.bitlenP/8]; 
       // Where P is the prime modulus
BYTE q[dsspubkeyver3.bitlenQ/8]; 
       // Where Q is a large factor of P-1
BYTE g[dsspubkeyver3.bitlenP/8]; 
       // Where G is the generator parameter
BYTE j[dsspubkeyver3.bitlenJ/8]; 
       // Where J is (P-1)/Q
BYTE y[dsspubkeyver3.bitlenP/8]; 
       // Where Y is (G^X) mod P
```



This [*BLOB*](../secgloss/b-gly.md) format is exported when the CRYPT\_BLOB\_VER3 flag is used with [**CryptExportKey**](/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptexportkey). Because the version is in the BLOB, there is no need to specify a flag when using this BLOB with [**CryptImportKey**](/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptimportkey).

In addition, this BLOB format is used with the [**CryptSetKeyParam**](/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptsetkeyparam) function when the *dwParam* value KP\_PUB\_PARAMS is used to set key parameters on a DSS key. This is done when the CRYPT\_PREGEN flag has been used to generate the key. When used in this situation, the y value is ignored and therefore should not be included in the BLOB.

The following table describes each component of the key BLOB.




| Field | Description | 
|-------|-------------|
| Blobheader | A <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-publickeystruc"><strong>BLOBHEADER</strong></a> structure. The <strong>bType</strong> member must have a value of PUBLICKEYBLOB. | 
| Dsspubkeyver3 | A <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa381983(v=vs.85)"><strong>DSSPUBKEY_VER3</strong></a> structure. The <strong>magic</strong> member should be set to "DSS3" (0x33535344) for public keys. Notice that the hexadecimal value is just an <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly"><em>ASCII</em></a> encoding of "DSS3."<br /> | 
| P | The P value is located directly after the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa381983(v=vs.85)"><strong>DSSPUBKEY_VER3</strong></a> structure, and should always be the length, in bytes, of the DSSPUBKEY_VER3 <strong>bitlenP</strong> field (bit length of P) divided by eight (<a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/l-gly"><em>little-endian</em></a> format). | 
| Q | The Q value is located directly after the P value and should always be the length in bytes of the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa381983(v=vs.85)"><strong>DSSPUBKEY_VER3</strong></a><strong>bitlenQ</strong> member divided by eight (<a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/l-gly"><em>little-endian</em></a> format). | 
| G | The G value is located directly after the Q value and should always be the length, in bytes, of the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa381983(v=vs.85)"><strong>DSSPUBKEY_VER3</strong></a><strong>bitlenP</strong> member (bit length of P) divided by eight. If the length of the data is one or more bytes shorter than P divided by 8, the data must be padded with the necessary bytes (of zero value) to make the data the desired length (<a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/l-gly"><em>little-endian</em></a> format). | 
| J | The J value is located directly after the G value and should always be the length in bytes of the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa381983(v=vs.85)"><strong>DSSPUBKEY_VER3</strong></a><strong>bitlenJ</strong> member divided by eight (<a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/l-gly"><em>little-endian</em></a> format). If the bitlenQ value is 0, then the value is absent from the BLOB. | 
| Y | The Y value, (G^X) mod P, is located directly after the J value, and should always be the length, in bytes, of the [**DSSPUBKEY_VER3**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa381983(v=vs.85))**bitlenP** member (bit length of P) divided by eight. If the length of the data that results from the calculation of (G^X) mod P is one or more bytes shorter than P divided by 8, the data must be padded with the necessary bytes (of zero value) to make the data the desired length ([**little-endian**](/windows/desktop/SecGloss/l-gly) format). **Note:** When this structure is used with [**CryptSetKeyParam**](/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptsetkeyparam) with the **dwParam** value KP_PUB_PARAMS, then this value is not included in the BLOB.<br> |
