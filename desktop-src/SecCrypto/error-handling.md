# Error Handling (Cryptography)

In all of the C examples that accompany each function's documentation, the example function [**MyHandleError**](myhandleerror.md) is used to print an error message and exit a procedure. In real situations, more extensive error handling procedures may be required. For more information, see [Example Program Limitations](example-program-limitations.md).
