# Session Keys

[*Session keys*](../secgloss/s-gly.md) are keys that are generated to be used in a single communication session. Session keys are frequently changed and are discarded when they are no longer needed. Typically a [*symmetric key*](../secgloss/s-gly.md) is used as the session key.

Session keys are volatile. Applications can save these keys for later use or for transmission to other users. For more information, see [Cryptographic Key Storage and Exchange](cryptographic-key-storage-and-exchange.md).
