# Hardware Cryptography

Certificate Services supports hardware-related cryptography, such as issuing certificates stored on [*smart cards*](../secgloss/s-gly.md). The enterprise [*certification authority*](../secgloss/c-gly.md) (CA) supports the issuance of smart card certificates for domain logon on the operating system. Additionally, both the enterprise CA and stand-alone CA support issuance of other types of smart card certificates.

For details, see the product documentation. For developer information about smart cards, see [Smart Card Authentication](../secauthn/smart-card-authentication.md). For information about the control that allows an administrator to request smart card certificates on behalf of users, see [Smart Card Enrollment Control](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secsmart/smart-card-enrollment-control-usage-scenario).
