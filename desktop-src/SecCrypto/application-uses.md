# Application Uses

Certificate Services issues certificates that can be used in public key infrastructure (PKI) applications. For example, the certificates work in SSL, S/MIME and IPSEC applications. Possible scenarios where these certificates can be used are digital signing and message encryption. Certificate Services provides certificates, [*certificate revocation lists*](../secgloss/c-gly.md) (CRL), and CRL distribution points (CDP) that are usable by both Microsoft and non-Microsoft applications.
