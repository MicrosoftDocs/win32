# PROV\_DSS

The PROV\_DSS provider type, like PROV\_RSA\_SIG, only supports [*hashes*](../secgloss/h-gly.md) and [*digital signatures*](../secgloss/d-gly.md). The signature algorithm specified by the PROV\_DSS provider type is the [*Digital Signature Algorithm*](../secgloss/d-gly.md) (DSA).

## Algorithms Supported

For descriptions of each of these algorithms, see the glossary.
