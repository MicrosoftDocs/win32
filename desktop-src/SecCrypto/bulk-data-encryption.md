# Bulk Data Encryption

A [*bulk encryption key*](../secgloss/b-gly.md) is generated by [*hashing*](../secgloss/h-gly.md) one of the MAC keys using [**CryptHashSessionKey**](/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-crypthashsessionkey) together with the message contents and other data. The message is encrypted/decrypted with one of the bulk encryption keys in the usual manner.

When using a [*block cipher*](../secgloss/b-gly.md), the [*Schannel*](../secgloss/s-gly.md) protocol engine does all necessary *block cipher* [*padding*](../secgloss/p-gly.md). When [**CryptEncrypt**](/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptencrypt) and [**CryptDecrypt**](/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptdecrypt) are called, the Final flag is always **FALSE** and the data length is a multiple of whole block lengths.

> [!Note]  
> The CSP must never buffer data internally. After the data has been encrypted (or decrypted), the size of the [*plaintext*](../secgloss/p-gly.md) must always exactly match the size of the [*ciphertext*](../secgloss/c-gly.md).
