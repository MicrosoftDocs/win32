# Example C Program: Verifying the Signature of a PE File

The [**WinVerifyTrust**](/windows/desktop/api/Wintrust/nf-wintrust-winverifytrust) API can be used to verify the signature of a portable executable file.

The following example shows how to use the [**WinVerifyTrust**](/windows/desktop/api/Wintrust/nf-wintrust-winverifytrust) API to verify the signature of a signed portable executable file.


```C++

// Copyright (C) Microsoft.  All rights reserved.
// Example of verifying the embedded signature of a PE file by using 
// the WinVerifyTrust function.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <windows.h>
#include <Softpub.h>

#include <wintrust.h>

// Link with the Wintrust.lib file.
#pragma comment (lib, "wintrust")

BOOL VerifyEmbeddedSignature(LPCWSTR pwszSourceFile)
{
    LONG lStatus;
    DWORD dwLastError;

    // Initialize the WINTRUST_FILE_INFO structure.

    WINTRUST_FILE_INFO FileData;
    memset(&FileData, 0, sizeof(FileData));
    FileData.cbStruct = sizeof(WINTRUST_FILE_INFO);
    FileData.pcwszFilePath = pwszSourceFile;
    FileData.hFile = NULL;
    FileData.pgKnownSubject = NULL;

    /*
    WVTPolicyGUID specifies the policy to apply on the file
    WINTRUST_ACTION_GENERIC_VERIFY_V2 policy checks:
    
    1) The certificate used to sign the file chains up to a root 
    certificate located in the trusted root certificate store. This 
    implies that the identity of the publisher has been verified by 
    a certification authority.
    
    2) In cases where user interface is displayed (which this example
    does not do), WinVerifyTrust will check for whether the  
    end entity certificate is stored in the trusted publisher store,  
    implying that the user trusts content from this publisher.
    
    3) The end entity certificate has sufficient permission to sign 
    code, as indicated by the presence of a code signing EKU or no 
    EKU.
