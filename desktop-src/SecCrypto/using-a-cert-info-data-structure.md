# Using a CERT\_INFO Data Structure

[**CERT\_CONTEXT**](/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_context) AND [**CERT\_INFO**](/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_info) are the main data structures holding the information in a certificate. When a certificate is used, it may need to be decoded. For more information, see [Decoding a CERT\_INFO Structure](decoding-a-cert-info-structure.md). Information may be added to a decoded **CERT\_INFO** structure and then the structure can be re-encoded. For details, see [Encoding a CERT\_INFO Structure](encoding-a-cert-info-structure.md).
