# COARefTime class

![coareftime class hierarchy](images/cutil05.png)

The `COARefTime` class converts reference times between seconds and 100-nanosecond units.

This class converts between reference times that are compatible with Automation and reference times that are compatible with C/C++. Automation-compatible interfaces use **double** values to represent time in seconds. Other interfaces use 64-bit **LONGLONG** values to represent time in 100-nanosecond units. The following types are defined for these values:

``` syntax
typedef LONGLONG  REFERENCE_TIME;
typedef double    REFTIME;
```

Filters can use the `COARefTime` class to convert between the two formats. This class is derived from the [**CRefTime**](creftime.md) class.
