# Balance Property

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `Balance` property sets or retrieves the speaker balance for the audio stream output.

``` syntax
[ iBalance = ] MSWebDVD.Balance
```

## Return Value

Returns an integer value representing the balance levels. The allowable input range is -10,000 to 10,000. A value of 0 sets a neutral balance, that is both left and right speakers are given the same amplitude audio signal.

## Remarks

This property is read/write with a default value of 0, meaning that both speakers receive equivalent audio signals. As with the [**Volume**](volume-property.md) property, units correspond to .01 decibels (multiplied by -1 when


```
iBalance
```



is a positive value). For example, a value of 1000 indicates 10 dB on the right channel and 90 dB on the left channel.
