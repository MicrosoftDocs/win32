# Stop Method (DirectShow)

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

> [!Note]  
> This component is available for use in the Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 operating systems. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions.

 

The `Stop` method stops playback.

``` syntax
MSWebDVD.Stop()
```

## Return Value

No return value.

## Remarks

If [**EnableResetOnStop**](enableresetonstop-property.md) is set to true, calling `Stop` puts the DVD Navigator, along with the rest of the filter graph, into a stopped state, which means that the next time the user presses the **Play** button, playback starts at the beginning of the disc. If **EnableResetOnStop** is set to true, playback resumes where it left off when the user issues the next **Play** command.
