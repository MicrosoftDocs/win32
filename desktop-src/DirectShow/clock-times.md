# Clock Times

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

DirectShow defines two related clock times: reference time and stream time.

-   *Reference time* is the absolute time returned by the reference clock. (See [Reference Clocks](reference-clocks.md).)
-   *Stream time* is defined relative to when the graph last started running.
    -   While the graph is running, stream time equals reference time minus start time.
    -   While the graph is paused, stream time remains at the stream time when it was paused.
    -   After a seek operation, stream time resets to zero.
    -   While the graph is stopped, stream time is undefined.

When a media sample has a time stamp *t*, it means the sample should be rendered at stream time *t*. For this reason, stream time is also called *presentation time*.

When an application calls [**IMediaControl::Run**](/windows/desktop/api/Control/nf-control-imediacontrol-run) to run the filter graph, the Filter Graph Manager calls [**IMediaFilter::Run**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-imediafilter-run) on each filter. To compensate for the slight amount of time it takes for the filters to start running, the Filter Graph Manager specifies a start time slightly in the future.
