# CBaseAllocator.Free method

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `Free` method releases all of the buffer memory. This method is called when the owning filter decommits the allocator, after the last media sample is released.

## Syntax


```C++
virtual void Free() = 0;
```



## Parameters

This method has no parameters.

## Return value

This method does not return a value.

## Remarks

After the [**Decommit**](cbaseallocator-decommit.md) method is called, the allocator calls this method when it releases the last media sample. The derived class must implement this method.
