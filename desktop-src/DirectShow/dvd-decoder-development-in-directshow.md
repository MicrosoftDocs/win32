# DVD Decoder Development in DirectShow

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This section contains pointers to the reference pages for all the DirectShow property sets and interfaces that are either DVD-specific or else used extensively in DVD decoding. In addition to what is listed here, a decoder and its pins must also support the generic DirectShow filter interfaces as described in [Writing DirectShow Filters](writing-directshow-filters.md).

This section contains the following topics.

-   [Decoder Volume Control](decoder-volume-control.md)
-   [DVD Region Change Support in Windows](dvd-region-change-support-in-windows.md)
