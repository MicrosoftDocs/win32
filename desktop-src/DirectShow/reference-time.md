# REFERENCE\_TIME

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **REFERENCE\_TIME** data type defines the units for reference times in DirectShow. Each unit of reference time is 100 nanoseconds.


```C++
typedef LONGLONG REFERENCE_TIME;
```



## Remarks

The **REFERENCE\_TIME** data type is a 64-bit integer.

Reference times are usually measured from one of the following baselines:

-   An absolute clock time. In this case, the baseline will depend on the implementation of the clock. For more information, see [Reference Clocks](reference-clocks.md).
-   Relative to the start of playback.

For more information about reference times, see [Time and Clocks in DirectShow](time-and-clocks-in-directshow.md).
