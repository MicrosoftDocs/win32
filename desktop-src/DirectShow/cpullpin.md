# CPullPin class

![cpullpin class hierarchy](images/pulpin01.png)

The `CPullPin` class provides support for input pins that pull data through the [**IAsyncReader**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-iasyncreader) interface. Use this class if you are implementing a filter that uses the pull model to request data from the upstream filter. For more information, see Data Flow in the Filter Graph and Pull Model.

This class does not derive from **CBasePin** or implement the [**IPin**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-ipin) interface, and some of the method names clash with **IPin**, so it is best used as a helper object inside your pin. To use this class, do the following:

1.  Derive a helper class from `CPullPin`, and derive an input pin class from **CBasePin**. Declare an instance of the `CPullPin` object as a member variable of the pin class.
2.  Override the [**CBasePin::CheckConnect**](cbasepin-checkconnect.md) method to call [**CPullPin::Connect**](cpullpin-connect.md). This method queries the other pin for **IAsyncReader**.
3.  Override the [**CBasePin::BreakConnect**](cbasepin-breakconnect.md) method to call [**CPullPin::Disconnect**](cpullpin-disconnect.md).
4.  Override the [**CBasePin::Active**](cbasepin-active.md) method to call [**CPullPin::Active**](cpullpin-active.md). This method starts up a worker thread that pulls samples from the upstream filter. When the pins connect, you can specify whether you want the worker thread to make asynchronous or synchronous read requests.
5.  Override the [**CBasePin::Inactive**](cbasepin-inactive.md) method to call [**CPullPin::Inactive**](cpullpin-inactive.md). This method shuts down the worker thread.
6.  Implement the pure virtual [**CPullPin::Receive**](cpullpin-receive.md) method to process incoming samples and deliver them downstream.
7.  To set the stop and start positions, or to seek the stream, call the [**CPullPin::Seek**](cpullpin-seek.md) method. This method pauses the worker thread and flushes the filter graph.
8.  Implement the pure virtual [**CPullPin::EndOfStream**](cpullpin-endofstream.md), [**CPullPin::BeginFlush**](cpullpin-beginflush.md), and [**CPullPin::EndFlush**](cpullpin-endflush.md) methods, as described in the remarks for those methods.
9.  Implement the pure virtual [**CPullPin::OnError**](cpullpin-onerror.md) method to handle streaming errors.
