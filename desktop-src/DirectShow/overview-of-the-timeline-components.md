# Overview of the Timeline Components

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

\[This API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.\]

The timeline in [DirectShow Editing Services](directshow-editing-services.md) (DES) is a COM component. The objects inside the timeline are also COM components. This article provides an overview of the interfaces exposed by the various objects.

This article contains the following topics:

-   [The Timeline](the-timeline.md)
-   [Timeline Objects](timeline-objects.md)
-   [Subobjects](subobjects.md)

For more information about timelines, see [The Timeline Model](the-timeline-model.md). For a list of components in DES, see [DirectShow Editing Services Objects](directshow-editing-services-objects.md).
