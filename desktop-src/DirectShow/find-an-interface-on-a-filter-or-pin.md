# Find an Interface on a Filter or Pin

For many operations in DirectShow, the application calls methods on the Filter Graph Manager. In some situations, however, the application must call a method directly on a filter or pin. For example, many filters expose specialized interfaces that are used to configure the filter.

In the case of a filter interface, you might already have a pointer to the filter's [**IBaseFilter**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-ibasefilter) interface. In that case, simply use **QueryInterface** to get the other interface. But some filters might be added to the graph by the Filter Graph Manager. (For details, see [Intelligent Connect](intelligent-connect.md).) In that case, use the [**IEnumFilters**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-ienumfilters) interface to loop through all the filters in the graph, and query each one in turn. The following function demonstrates this:


```C++
HRESULT FindFilterInterface(
    IGraphBuilder *pGraph, // Pointer to the Filter Graph Manager.
    REFGUID iid,           // IID of the interface to retrieve.
    void **ppUnk)          // Receives the interface pointer.
{
    if (!pGraph || !ppUnk) return E_POINTER;

    HRESULT hr = E_FAIL;
    IEnumFilters *pEnum = NULL;
    IBaseFilter *pF = NULL;
    if (FAILED(pGraph->EnumFilters(&pEnum)))
    {
        return E_FAIL;
    }
    // Query every filter for the interface.
    while (S_OK == pEnum->Next(1, &pF, 0))
    {
        hr = pF->QueryInterface(iid, ppUnk);
        pF->Release();
        if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
        {
            break;
        }
    }
    pEnum->Release();
    return hr;
}
```



To find an interface on a pin, use the [**IEnumPins**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-ienumpins) interface to loop through the pins on a filter. The following function shows how to do this:


```C++
HRESULT FindPinInterface(
    IBaseFilter *pFilter,  // Pointer to the filter to search.
    REFGUID iid,           // IID of the interface.
    void **ppUnk)          // Receives the interface pointer.
{
    if (!pFilter || !ppUnk) return E_POINTER;

    HRESULT hr = E_FAIL;
    IEnumPins *pEnum = 0;
    if (FAILED(pFilter->EnumPins(&pEnum)))
    {
        return E_FAIL;
    }
    // Query every pin for the interface.
    IPin *pPin = 0;
    while (S_OK == pEnum->Next(1, &pPin, 0))
    {
        hr = pPin->QueryInterface(iid, ppUnk);
        pPin->Release();
        if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
        {
            break;
        }
    }
    pEnum->Release();
    return hr;
}
```



The next function searches for an interface on a filter or a pin:


```C++
HRESULT FindInterfaceAnywhere(
    IGraphBuilder *pGraph, 
    REFGUID iid, 
    void **ppUnk)
{
    if (!pGraph || !ppUnk) return E_POINTER;
    HRESULT hr = E_FAIL;
    IEnumFilters *pEnum = 0;
    if (FAILED(pGraph->EnumFilters(&pEnum)))
    {
        return E_FAIL;
    }
    // Loop through every filter in the graph.
    IBaseFilter *pF = 0;
    while (S_OK == pEnum->Next(1, &pF, 0))
    {
        hr = pF->QueryInterface(iid, ppUnk);
        if (FAILED(hr))
        {
            // The filter does not expose the interface, but maybe
            // one of its pins does.
            hr = FindPinInterface(pF, iid, ppUnk);
        }
        pF->Release();
        if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
        {
            break;
        }
    }
    pEnum->Release();
    return hr;
}
```



Note that all of the functions shown here stop at the first successful **QueryInterface**.
