# previewmode Attribute

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

> [!Note]  
> \[Deprecated. This API may be removed from future releases of Windows.\]

 

The `previewmode` attribute specifies the preview mode for the group. If the value is **TRUE**, frames might be dropped during preview. Otherwise, no frames are dropped during preview. The default value is **TRUE**.

## Possible Values

The following values are defined as TRUE: y, Y, t, T, 1. The following values are defined as FALSE: n, N, f, F, 0 (zero).

## Applies To

[**group**](group-element.md)

## Remarks

Under the default setting, frames are dropped while previewing slow effects or transitions, to keep the video synchronized with the audio. The video might look choppy as a result. Setting this attribute to **FALSE** forces every frame to render during preview, possibly resulting in the video becoming out of sync with the audio. Frames are never dropped when writing to a file.
