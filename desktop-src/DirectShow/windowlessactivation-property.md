# WindowlessActivation Property

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

> [!Note]  
> This component is available for use in the Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 operating systems. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions.

 

The `WindowlessActivation` property initializes the **MSWebDVD** object at design time for either windowed or windowless mode.

``` syntax
[ bWindowless = ] MSWebDVD.WindowlessActivation
```

## Return Value

Returns whether the object is in windowed mode as a Boolean.

## Remarks

This property is read/write with a default value of true. Therefore, you only need to set this property if you are running the **MSWebDVD** object in a windowed container. When contained in a Web page in Microsoft® Internet Explorer, **MSWebDVD** is always in windowless mode, and you don't need to set this property.
