# DirectShow Filters

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer) and [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine). **MediaPlayer** and **IMFMediaEngine** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** and **IMFMediaEngine** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

DirectShow provides a set of default filters in Windows. These filters support many data formats while providing a high degree of hardware independence. An application can also register and install custom filters on the target system.

The ACM Wrapper, AVI Decompressor and AVI Compressor filters work with the Audio and Video Compression Managers to enable various codecs to be used in a DirectShow filter graph.

All the filters supported by the DirectShow Software Development Kit (SDK) are listed here. If a filter appears in GraphEdit but is not documented in this reference section, it means the filter has either been installed by a third party or is used internally by some other Microsoft technology. Such filters are not supported by the DirectShow SDK.
