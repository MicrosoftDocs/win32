# CBaseAllocator::m\_bDecommitInProgress member

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Flag indicating whether a decommit operation is in progress. The value is **TRUE** after the [**CBaseAllocator::Decommit**](cbaseallocator-decommit.md) method is called, but before all the buffers have been released. If the value is **TRUE**, the [**CBaseAllocator::GetBuffer**](cbaseallocator-getbuffer.md) method fails. Also, the allocator should not deleted itself while the value is **TRUE**.

## Syntax


```C++
BOOL m_bDecommitInProgress;
```
