# The Timeline

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

\[This API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.\]

The timeline exposes the [**IAMTimeline**](iamtimeline.md) interface. This interface contains methods for setting properties on the timeline; for adding groups to the timeline; and for creating timeline objects, such as groups, tracks, and sources. To create a new timeline, call the standard **CoCreateInstance** function as follows:


```C++
IAMTimeline *pTL = NULL;
hr = CoCreateInstance(CLSID_AMTimeline, NULL, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, 
        IID_IAMTimeline, (void**)&pTL);
```



The new timeline is empty. At this point you can either load an existing project file (see [Loading and Previewing a Project](loading-and-previewing-a-project.md)), or build up the timeline by creating and inserting new objects (see [Constructing a Timeline](constructing-a-timeline.md)).
