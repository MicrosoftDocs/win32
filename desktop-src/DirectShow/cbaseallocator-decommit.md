# CBaseAllocator.Decommit method

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `Decommit` method decommits the allocator. This method implements the [**IMemAllocator::Decommit**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-imemallocator-decommit) method.

## Syntax


```C++
HRESULT Decommit();
```



## Parameters

This method has no parameters.

## Return value

Returns S\_OK.

## Remarks

After this method is called, calls to the [**CBaseAllocator::GetBuffer**](cbaseallocator-getbuffer.md) method will fail. As samples are released, they get returned to the free list. When the last sample is returned, the allocator calls the [**CBaseAllocator::Free**](cbaseallocator-free.md) method, which releases the allocated memory. (In the base class, **Free** is a pure virtual method.)

In addition, this method releases any threads that are blocked on **GetBuffer** calls. The calls to **GetBuffer** fail.
