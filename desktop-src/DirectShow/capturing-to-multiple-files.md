# Capturing to Multiple Files

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

After you have captured some video to a file, you can switch to a new file by stopping the graph and setting the file name on the [File Writer](file-writer-filter.md) filter. Call the [**IFileSinkFilter::SetFileName**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-ifilesinkfilter-setfilename) method on the File Writer. You can get a pointer to the [**IFileSinkFilter**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-ifilesinkfilter) interface when you build the graph, through the *pSink* parameter of the SetOutputFileName method. The following code shows how to do this:


```C++
IBaseFilter *pMux;
IFileSinkFilter *pSink
hr = pBuild->SetOutputFileName(&MEDIASUBTYPE_Avi, L"C:\\YourFileName.avi", 
    &pMux, &pSink);
if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
{
    hr = pBuild->RenderStream(&PIN_CATEGORY_CAPTURE, &MEDIATYPE_Video, 
        pCap, NULL, pMux);

    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
    {
        pControl->Run();
        /* Wait awhile, then stop the graph. */
        pControl->Stop();
        // Change the file name and run the graph again.
        pSink->SetFileName(L"YourFileName02.avi", 0);
        pControl->Run();
    }
    pMux->Release();
    pSink->Release();
}
```
