# Exposing Capture and Compression Formats

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This article describes how to return capture and compression formats by using the [**IAMStreamConfig::GetStreamCaps**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-iamstreamconfig-getstreamcaps) method. This method can get more information about accepted media types than the traditional way of enumerating a pin's media types, so it should typically be used instead. **GetStreamCaps** can return information about the kinds of formats allowed for audio or video. Additionally, this article provides some sample code that demonstrates how to reconnect the input pin of a transform filter to ensure your filter can produce a particular output.

The **GetStreamCaps** method returns an array of pairs of media type and capabilities structures. The media type is an [**AM\_MEDIA\_TYPE**](/windows/win32/api/strmif/ns-strmif-am_media_type) structure and the capabilities are represented either by an [**AUDIO\_STREAM\_CONFIG\_CAPS**](/windows/win32/api/strmif/ns-strmif-audio_stream_config_caps) structure or a [**VIDEO\_STREAM\_CONFIG\_CAPS**](/windows/win32/api/strmif/ns-strmif-video_stream_config_caps) structure. The first section in this article presents a video example and the second presents an audio example.
