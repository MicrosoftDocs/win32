# AVI/WAV File Source

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

(Deprecated. For AVI and WAV files, use the [File Source (Async)](file-source--async--filter.md) and the [AVI Splitter](avi-splitter-filter.md) or [WAVE Parser](wave-parser-filter.md).)

The AVI/WAV File Source filter reads AVI and WAV source files and generates the appropriate output pins for the file type.

For WAV files, the filter creates an audio output pin, which produces an audio stream that can be connected to an audio rendering filter or intervening audio transform filter.

For AVI files, the filter creates a video output pin, which produces a compressed AVI stream suitable for the AVI codec filter, and an audio output pin, which produces an audio stream suitable for an audio rendering filter or an intervening audio transform filter.
