# Rendering a Project

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer) and [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine). **MediaPlayer** and **IMFMediaEngine** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** and **IMFMediaEngine** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

\[This API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.\]

This section describes how to render a video editing project in [DirectShow Editing Services](directshow-editing-services.md) (DES). It contains the following topics.
