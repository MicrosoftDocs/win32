# DirectX Video Acceleration Video Subtypes

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The following subtypes are used by decoders that are using DirectX Video Acceleration (DXVA). AI44 and IA44 are surfaces with a bits-per-pixel value of 8. There are 4 bits of I and 4 bits of *A*. *I* represents an index into a 16-entry YUV palette. *A* represents 4 bits of transparency information (also known as per-pixel-alpha). Therefore, AI44 and IA44 surfaces allow for 16 different colors at 16 different transparency values, or 256 different pixel representations. With AI44 the alpha is stored in the hi-nibble, in IA44 the alpha is stored in the lo-nibble. Both formats are very useful for DVD sub-picture images and Line21 and Teletext images. Microsoft prefers the AI44 version because it is slightly easier to generate text using this format.
