# How to Create a DirectShow Filter DLL

This article describes how to implement a component as a dynamic-link library (DLL) in Microsoft DirectShow. This article is a continuation from [How to Implement IUnknown](how-to-implement-iunknown.md), which describes how to implement the **IUnknown** interface by deriving your component from the [**CUnknown**](cunknown.md) base class.

This article contains the following sections.

-   [Class Factories and Factory Templates](class-factories-and-factory-templates.md)
-   [Factory Template Array](factory-template-array.md)
-   [DLL Functions](dll-functions.md)

Registering a DirectShow filter (as opposed to a generic COM object) requires some additional steps that are not covered in this article. For information on registering filters, see [How to Register DirectShow Filters](how-to-register-directshow-filters.md).
