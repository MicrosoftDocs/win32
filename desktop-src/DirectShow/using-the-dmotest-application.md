# Using the DMOTest Application

> [!Note]  
> The DMOTest application is no longer available in the SDK.

 

The DMOTest utility can help verify that a DMO meets the DMO specifications. If you develop a DMO, you should include the DMO test application as part of your testing.

DMOTest is installed in the Bin\\DXUtils directory, under the SDK root directory. To use DMOTest, you must first generate some test data for the DMO. The SDK includes a DirectShow filter for this purpose. Details about the filter and the DMOTest application can be found in the DMOTest application Help. In the application, choose **Contents** from the **Help** menu. The Help includes step-by-step instructions for generating test data and running tests.
