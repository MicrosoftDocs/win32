# PlayCap Sample

## Description

Simple capture application.

This application creates a preview window for the first video capture device that it locates on the user's system (if any). It demonstrates a simple example of using the [**ICaptureGraphBuilder2**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-icapturegraphbuilder2) and [**ICreateDevEnum**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-icreatedevenum) interfaces to build a capture graph.

For a sample capture application that supports more features, see [AmCap Sample](amcap-sample.md).
