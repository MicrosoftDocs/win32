# PlayCap Sample

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

## Description

Simple capture application.

This application creates a preview window for the first video capture device that it locates on the user's system (if any). It demonstrates a simple example of using the [**ICaptureGraphBuilder2**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-icapturegraphbuilder2) and [**ICreateDevEnum**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-icreatedevenum) interfaces to build a capture graph.

For a sample capture application that supports more features, see [AmCap Sample](amcap-sample.md).
