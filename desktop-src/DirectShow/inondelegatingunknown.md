# INonDelegatingUnknown

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `INonDelegatingUnknown` interface is a version of **IUnknown** that is renamed to enable support for both nondelegating and delegating **IUnknown** interfaces in the same COM object.

## Syntax


```C++
interface INonDelegatingUnknown
{
    virtual HRESULT NonDelegatingQueryInterface(REFIID riid, LPVOID *ppv) PURE;
    virtual ULONG NonDelegatingAddRef(void) PURE;
    virtual ULONG NonDelegatingRelease(void) PURE;
};
```



## Remarks

To use `INonDelegatingUnknown` for multiple inheritance, perform the following steps.

1.  Derive your class from an interface, for example, IMyInterface.
2.  Include [**DECLARE\_IUNKNOWN**](declare-iunknown.md) in your class definition to declare implementations of **QueryInterface**, **AddRef**, and **Release** that call the outer unknown.
3.  Override **NonDelegatingQueryInterface** to expose IMyInterface with code such as the following:
    ```C++
         if (riid == IID_IMyInterface) {
             return GetInterface((IMyInterface *) this, ppv);
         } else {
             return CUnknown::NonDelegatingQueryInterface(riid, ppv);
         }
    ```

    

4.  Declare and implement the member functions of IMyInterface.

To use `INonDelegatingUnknown` for nested interfaces, perform the following steps:

1.  Declare a class derived from [**CUnknown**](cunknown.md).
2.  Include [**DECLARE\_IUNKNOWN**](declare-iunknown.md) in your class definition.
3.  Override **NonDelegatingQueryInterface** to expose IMyInterface with the code such as the following:
    ```C++
         if (riid == IID_IMyInterface) {
             return GetInterface((IMyInterface *) this, ppv);
         } else {
             return CUnknown::NonDelegatingQueryInterface(riid, ppv);
         }
    ```

    

4.  Implement the member functions of IMyInterface. Use [**CUnknown::GetOwner**](cunknown-getowner.md) to access the COM object class.
5.  In your COM object class, make the nested class a friend of the COM object class, and declare an instance of the nested class as a member of the COM object class.

Because you must always pass the outer unknown and an **HRESULT** to the [**CUnknown**](cunknown.md) constructor, you can't use a default constructor. You have to make the member variable a pointer to the class and make a new call in your constructor to actually create it.

Override the **NonDelegatingQueryInterface** with code such as the following:


```C++
     if (riid == IID_IMyInterface) {
         return m_pImplFilter->
            NonDelegatingQueryInterface(IID_IMyInterface, ppv);
     } else {
         return CUnknown::NonDelegatingQueryInterface(riid, ppv);
     }
```



You can have mixed classes that support some interfaces through multiple inheritance and some interfaces through nested classes.
