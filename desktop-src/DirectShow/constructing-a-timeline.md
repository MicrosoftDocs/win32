# Constructing a Timeline

\[This API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.\]

This article describes how to construct a timeline in [DirectShow Editing Services](directshow-editing-services.md) (DES). It presents an example console application that creates a timeline and renders it. The timeline is minimal, consisting of a single video group with one source clip, but it demonstrates most of the concepts needed to create more complex timelines.
