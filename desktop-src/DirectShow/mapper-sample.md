# Mapper Sample

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

## Description

This sample demonstrates using the [**IFilterMapper2::EnumMatchingFilters**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-ifiltermapper2-enummatchingfilters) method to locate filters in the registry.

The sample application's UI contains controls that match the parameters of the [**EnumMatchingFilters**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-ifiltermapper2-enummatchingfilters) method, such as minimum merit value, pin categories, and media types. Select the search options that you want, then click the **Search** button to enumerate the filters that match those options.
