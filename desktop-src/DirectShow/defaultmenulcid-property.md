# DefaultMenuLCID Property

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `DVDAdm.DefaultMenuLCID` property sets or retrieves the registry setting for the user-specified default LCID for menus.

``` syntax
[ iMenuLCID = ] DVD.DVDAdm.DefaultMenuLCID
```

## Return Value

Returns an Integer value representing the LCID as stored in the registry settings for the DVD application. This value is not necessarily the same as the default menu language as authored on the DVD. For the range of valid LCIDs, see the Win32 documentation in the Platform SDK.

## Remarks

This property is read/write with no default value. If no default menu LCID is specified, the MSDVDAdm object will use the language that is marked as the default menu language on the disc.
