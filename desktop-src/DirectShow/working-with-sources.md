# Working with Sources

\[This API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.\]

A source object represents a single media stream from a source file. Sources provide the raw material for a project. Everything else in the timeline exists either to provide structure (tracks, compositions, and groups) or to modify sources (effects and transitions).

This article describes various details relating to sources in Microsoft® DirectShow® Editing Services (DES). For information on the basic steps needed to add a source to the timeline, see [Constructing a Timeline](constructing-a-timeline.md).

This article contains the following sections.
