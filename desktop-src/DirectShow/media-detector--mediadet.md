# Media Detector (MediaDet)

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

> [!Note]  
> \[Deprecated. This API may be removed from future releases of Windows.\]

 

The Media Detector (MediaDet) object retrieves format information and still frames from file sources. The Media Detector does not require the Filter Graph Manager to function. To create this object, call **CoCreateInstance**. The class identifier is CLSID\_MediaDet.

To read Windows Media™ files, the application must provide a software certificate, also called a key. Register the application as a key provider through the Media Detector's **IObjectWithSite** interface. For more information, see [Unlocking the Windows Media Format SDK](unlocking-the-windows-media-format-sdk.md).

The MediaDet object exposes the following interfaces:

-   [**IMediaDet**](imediadet.md)
-   **IObjectWithSite**
