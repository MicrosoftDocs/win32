# CMediaSample::m\_pAllocator member

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer) and [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine). **MediaPlayer** and **IMFMediaEngine** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** and **IMFMediaEngine** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Pointer to the allocator that created this sample.

## Syntax


```C++
CBaseAllocator *m_pAllocator;
```



## Remarks

Although the sample keeps a pointer to the allocator, it does not hold a reference count. Instead, the allocator increments its own reference count in the [**IMemAllocator::GetBuffer**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-imemallocator-getbuffer) method, and releases itself in the [**IMemAllocator::ReleaseBuffer**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-imemallocator-releasebuffer) method. This guarantees that the allocator will be available as long as another object is using the sample.
