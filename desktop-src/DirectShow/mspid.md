# MSPID

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **MSPID** data type identifies the purpose of a media steam.


```C++
typedef GUID MSPID;
typedef REFGUID REFMSPID;
```



## Remarks

**MSPID** is simply a typedef for GUID. The following MSPIDs are defined.



| Value               | Description           |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| MSPID\_PrimaryVideo | Primary video stream. |
| MSPID\_PrimaryAudio | Primary audio stream. |



 

The **REFMSPID** type defines a reference to an **MSPID**.
