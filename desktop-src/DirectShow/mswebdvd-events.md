The MSWebDVD Microsoft® ActiveX® control notifies your application when various types of internal events occur or when certain information is encountered on the disc.

Most of the events relate to user operation (UOP) controls. DVD authors can encode the disc so that any DVD command (such as **PlayForwards**, **Pause**, **ShowMenu**, and so on) can be disabled at any time. For example, most discs will not allow users to fast forward or show a menu while the FBI warning is playing. After the warning is over, the disc permits these operations. By handling the UOP events, your application can update its user interface to show the user which commands are currently permitted by the disc. The most common way to do this is by disabling a button. For example, if your application received a PlayForwards event with **bEnabled** set to **FALSE**, you could disable the Play button. When it received that event with **bEnabled** set to **TRUE**, you could enable the button again.

There are three events that do not relate to UOP controls. The **DVDNotify** event notifies your application of many different types of DVD-related events, which are identified in the *EventCode* parameter. Some events have additional information in the *Param1* and *Param2* parameters. The **ReadyStateChange** event notifies your application of changes in the MSWebDVD ReadyState property, which is a property common to all ActiveX controls. The **UpdateOverlay** event is sent to applications only if they are hosting MSWebDVD in windowless mode. Applications need to respond to this event only if they are displaying floating buttons over the video rectangle in full screen mode.
