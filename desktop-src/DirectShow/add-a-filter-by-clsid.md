# Add a Filter by CLSID

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The following function creates a filter with a specified class identifier (CLSID) and adds it to the filter graph:


```C++
// Create a filter by CLSID and add it to the graph.

HRESULT AddFilterByCLSID(
    IGraphBuilder *pGraph,      // Pointer to the Filter Graph Manager.
    REFGUID clsid,              // CLSID of the filter to create.
    IBaseFilter **ppF,          // Receives a pointer to the filter.
    LPCWSTR wszName             // A name for the filter (can be NULL).
    )
{
    *ppF = 0;

    IBaseFilter *pFilter = NULL;
    
    HRESULT hr = CoCreateInstance(clsid, NULL, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, 
        IID_PPV_ARGS(&pFilter));
    if (FAILED(hr))
    {
        goto done;
    }

    hr = pGraph->AddFilter(pFilter, wszName);
    if (FAILED(hr))
    {
        goto done;
    }

    *ppF = pFilter;
    (*ppF)->AddRef();

done:
    SafeRelease(&pFilter);
    return hr;
}
```



> [!Note]  
> This example uses the [SafeRelease](/windows/desktop/medfound/saferelease) function to release the [**IBaseFilter**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-ibasefilter) pointer.

 

The function calls [**CoCreateInstance**](/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cocreateinstance) to create the filter, and then calls [**IFilterGraph::AddFilter**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-ifiltergraph-addfilter) to add the filter to the graph. The following code example uses this function to add the [AVI Mux](avi-mux-filter.md) filter to the graph:


```C++
IBaseFilter *pMux;
hr = AddFilterByCLSID(pGraph, CLSID_AviDest, L"AVI Mux", &pMux, NULL); 
if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
{
    /* ... */
   pMux->Release();
}
```



Note that some filters cannot be created with [**CoCreateInstance**](/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cocreateinstance). This is often the case with filters that manage other software components. For example, the [AVI Compressor](avi-compressor-filter.md) filter is a wrapper for video codecs, and the [WDM Video Capture](wdm-video-capture-filter.md) filter is a wrapper for WDM capture drivers. These filters must be created using either the [System Device Enumerator](system-device-enumerator.md) or the [Filter Mapper](filter-mapper.md). For more information, see [Enumerating Devices and Filters](enumerating-devices-and-filters.md).
