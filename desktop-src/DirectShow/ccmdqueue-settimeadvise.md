# CCmdQueue.SetTimeAdvise method

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `SetTimeAdvise` method sets up a timer event with the reference clock.

## Syntax


```C++
void SetTimeAdvise();
```



## Parameters

This method has no parameters.

## Return value

This method does not return a value.

## Remarks

This member function calls the [**IReferenceClock::AdviseTime**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-ireferenceclock-advisetime) method to set up a notification for the earliest time required in the queue. Presentation-time commands that are deferred are always checked. If the filter graph is in running mode, deferred commands using stream time are also checked.
