# CVideoTransformFilter class

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `CVideoTransformFilter` class is designed primarily as a base class for AVI decompressor filters. This class adds support for quality control to the [**CTransformFilter**](ctransformfilter.md) class. The filter's **Receive** method can decide to drop frames, based on quality messages from the renderer and performance measurements that the filter collects while it is streaming.

If the filter drops a frame, it continues to drop frames until it reaches the next key frame. For MPEG streams, the filter does not distinguish between B frames and P frames.
