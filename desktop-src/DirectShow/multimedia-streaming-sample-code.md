> These APIs are deprecated. Applications should use the [**Sample Grabber**](sample-grabber-filter.md) filter or implement a custom filter to get data from a DirectShow filter graph.

 

This article provides sample code that implements the multimedia streaming interfaces. The video streaming sample code demonstrates how to read a file and render it to a primary Microsoft® DirectDraw® surface. For brevity, this code contains no error checking.

The second code sample demonstrates how to use the audio streaming interfaces to stream audio data.

This article contains the following sections.
