# GetVideoSize Method

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `GetVideoSize` method retrieves the native video dimensions.

``` syntax
[ oSizeRect = ] MSWebDVD.GetVideoSize()
```

## Return Value

Returns a [DVDRect](dvdrect-object.md) object containing four read/write properties: (top left) x; (top left) y, Width, and Height. The **x** and **y** properties are set to zero and the other two properties reflect the width and height of the video rectangle as authored on the disc.
