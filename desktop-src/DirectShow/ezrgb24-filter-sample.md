# EZRGB24 Filter Sample

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

## Description

The EZRGB24 filter is an image processing transform filter. This filter performs a number of individual video effects, including red, green, blue, darken, XOR, blur, gray, and emboss effects.

This sample shows how to use several DirectShow base classes, including [**CTransformFilter**](ctransformfilter.md), [**CPersistStream**](cpersiststream.md), and [**CBasePropertyPage**](cbasepropertypage.md).

## Downloading the Sample
