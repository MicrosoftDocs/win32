# CTransformFilter::m\_bEOSDelivered member

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Flag that indicates whether the filter has sent an end-of-stream notification.

## Syntax


```C++
BOOL m_bEOSDelivered;
```



## Remarks

If the filter pauses when it does not have an input connection, it sends an end-of-stream notification downstream and sets this flag to **TRUE**. The end-of-stream notification ensures that the downstream filter does not wait for samples. Note that the filter's [**EndOfStream**](ctransformfilter-endofstream.md) method does not set this flag.
