# UpdateOverlay

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **UpdateOverlay** event is sent when the overlay surface has been moved or resized or its color key has changed.

``` syntax
UpdateOverlay()
```

## Remarks

Applications should never be concerned about the overlay surface being resized or moved. This is all handled internally. But this event is also sent when the color key changes. That means that if an application is hosting MSWebDVD as a windowless control and displaying floating buttons on top of the video surface in full-screen mode, it should respond to this event by getting the new value of the **ColorKey** property so that it can draw the buttons properly.
