# Async Filter Sample

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

## Description

The Async Filter sample is a file reader filter that supports progressive download. This sample filter implements the [**IAsyncReader**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-iasyncreader) and [**IFileSourceFilter**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-ifilesourcefilter) interfaces. It supports MPEG files, but not AVI files.

## Usage

This sample includes a small command-line application, Memfile.exe, that demonstrates the filter. The command-line arguments specify a media file and a bit rate, in kilobytes per second. The application reads the file into memory at the specified rate and plays the file. To do so, it creates an instance of the filter, adds the filter to the filter graph, and renders the filter's output pin.

At the command line, type:

**Memfile Filename BitRate**  

The Async sample filter does not support AVI files, because it cannot connect to the [AVI Splitter](avi-splitter-filter.md) filter. The Async filter's output pin proposes MEDIATYPE\_Stream and MEDIASUBTYPE\_NULL for the media type. The input pin on the AVI Splitter filter does not accept MEDIASUBTYPE\_NULL, and does not propose any types of its own. Therefore, the pin connection fails. The Async filter could be enhanced to offer MEDIASUBTYPE\_Avi when appropriate. For example, it could examine the file format, or use the file extension.

## Downloading the Sample
