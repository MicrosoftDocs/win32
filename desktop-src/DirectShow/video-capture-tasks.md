# Video Capture Tasks

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This section describes the following tasks that a video capture application might need to perform:

-   [Configuring a Video Capture Device](configuring-a-video-capture-device.md)
-   [Working with Crossbars](working-with-crossbars.md)
-   [Device Removal Notification](device-removal-notification.md)
-   [Capturing an Image From a Still Image Pin](capturing-an-image-from-a-still-image-pin.md)
