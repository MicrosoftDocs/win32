# Country/Region Assignments

International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standard country calling codes are passed to the [**IAMTuner::put\_CountryCode**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-iamtuner-put_countrycode) method to select default television frequency mappings.

For example, passing 20, the ITU-T calling code for Egypt, would select default television frequencies for Egypt.

For a list of country calling codes, refer to the current ITU-T recommendation of assigned country codes.
