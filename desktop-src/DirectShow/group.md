# Group (DirectShow)

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

> [!Note]  
> \[Deprecated. This API may be removed from future releases of Windows.\]

 

The group object represents a top-level composition. Each group defines one video or audio stream in the final project. To create this object, call the [**IAMTimeline::CreateEmptyNode**](iamtimeline-createemptynode.md) method.

The group object exposes the following interfaces:

-   [**IAMTimelineComp**](iamtimelinecomp.md)
-   [**IAMTimelineGroup**](iamtimelinegroup.md)
-   [**IAMTimelineObj**](iamtimelineobj.md)
