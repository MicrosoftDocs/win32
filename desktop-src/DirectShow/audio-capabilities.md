# Audio Capabilities

For audio capabilities, [**IAMStreamConfig::GetStreamCaps**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-iamstreamconfig-getstreamcaps) returns an array of pairs of [**AM\_MEDIA\_TYPE**](/windows/win32/api/strmif/ns-strmif-am_media_type) and [**AUDIO\_STREAM\_CONFIG\_CAPS**](/windows/win32/api/strmif/ns-strmif-audio_stream_config_caps) structures. As with video, you can use this to expose all kinds of audio capabilities on the pin, such as data rate and whether it supports mono or stereo.

For video-related examples relating to GetStreamCaps, see [Video Capabilities](video-capabilities.md).

Suppose you support pulse code modulation (PCM) wave format (as represented by the [**WAVEFORMATEX**](/previous-versions/dd757713(v=vs.85)) structure) at sampling rates of 11,025, 22,050, and 44,100 samples per second, all at 8- or 16-bit mono or stereo. In this case, you would offer two pairs of structures. The first pair would have an **AUDIO\_STREAM\_CONFIG\_CAPS** capability structure saying you support a minimum of 11,025 to a maximum of 22,050 samples per second with a granularity of 11,025 samples per second (granularity is the difference between supported values); an 8-bit minimum to a 16-bit maximum bits per sample with a granularity of 8 bits per sample; and one-channel minimum and two-channel maximum. The first pair's media type would be your default PCM format in that range, perhaps 22 kilohertz (kHz), 16-bit stereo. Your second pair would be a capability showing 44,100 for both minimum and maximum samples per second; 8-bit (minimum) and 16-bit (maximum) bits per sample, with a granularity of 8 bits per sample; and one-channel minimum and two-channel maximum. The media type would be your default 44 kHz format, perhaps 44 kHz 16-bit stereo.

If you support non-PCM wave formats, the media type returned by this method can show which non-PCM formats you support (with a default sample rate, bit rate, and channels) and the capabilities structure accompanying that media type can describe which other sample rates, bit rates, and channels you support.
