# CDrawImage::m\_bUsingImageAllocator member

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `m_bUsingImageAllocator` member variable indicates whether the allocator for the pin connection is a **CImageAllocator** object. If the value is **TRUE**, the allocator is a **CImageAllocator** object (or is derived from that class).

## Syntax


```C++
BOOL m_bUsingImageAllocator;
```



## Remarks

When the value is **TRUE**, the **CDrawImage** object can use the GDI **BitBlt** and **StretchBlt** functions to render the image, rather than the slower **SetDIBitsToDevice** and **StretchDIBits** functions.
