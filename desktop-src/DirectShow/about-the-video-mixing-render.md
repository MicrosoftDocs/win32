# About the Video Mixing Render

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This section provides an overview of the features in the Video Mixing Renderer 7 (VMR-7) and the VMR-9.
