# CMsgThread class

The `CMsgThread` class is a worker-thread class that queues requests to the queuing thread for completion asynchronously. To use this class, derive your class from it and override the [**CMsgThread::ThreadMessageProc**](cmsgthread-threadmessageproc.md) member function. The **ThreadMessageProc** member function carries out each request. Your client functions and the **ThreadMessageProc** member function must share a common definition of the parameters in the [**CMsg**](cmsg.md) object.

A negotiated mechanism tells the worker thread to exit. Typically, this will be one value of the [**CMsg**](cmsg.md) class's **uMsg** message code.

It is a good idea to send this message from the destructor of your derived class, and call the [**CMsgThread::WaitForThreadExit**](cmsgthread-waitforthreadexit.md) member function before completing the destruction of the derived class.
