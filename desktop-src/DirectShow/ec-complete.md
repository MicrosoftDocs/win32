# EC\_COMPLETE

All data from a particular stream has been rendered.

## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

<span id="lParam1"></span><span id="lparam1"></span><span id="LPARAM1"></span>*lParam1*
</dt> <dd>

(**HRESULT**) Status of the stream on completion. If no errors occurred during playback, the value is S\_OK.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="lParam2"></span><span id="lparam2"></span><span id="LPARAM2"></span>*lParam2*
</dt> <dd>

(**IUnknown**\*) Zero, or a pointer to the renderer's [**IBaseFilter**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-ibasefilter) interface.

</dd> </dl>

## Default Action

By default, the filter graph manager does not forward this event to the application. However, after all the streams in the graph report **EC\_COMPLETE**, the filter graph manager posts a separate **EC\_COMPLETE** event to the application.

If the default action is disabled for this event, the application receives all of the **EC\_COMPLETE** events from the renderers.

## Remarks

A renderer filter sends this event when it receives an end-of-stream notice. (End-of-stream is signaled through the [**IPin::EndOfStream**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-ipin-endofstream) method.) The filter sends exactly one **EC\_COMPLETE** event for each stream. The filter must process any pending samples before it sends the event. Stopping a renderer resets any end-of-stream state that was cached.

If the renderer is paused, it does not send **EC\_COMPLETE** until the [**IMediaFilter::Run**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-imediafilter-run) method is called. Furthermore, it continues to send **EC\_COMPLETE** events for each transition from pause to run, until the filter is either stopped or flushed.

Filters set the *lParam2* parameter to an [**IBaseFilter**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-ibasefilter) pointer. If the default action is enabled, the filter graph manager sets this parameter to zero.
