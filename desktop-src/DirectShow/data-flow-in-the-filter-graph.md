# Data Flow in the Filter Graph

This section describes how media data moves through the filter graph. Usually, you do not need to know these details to write a DirectShow application, although in some situations you may find it helpful. If you are writing a DirectShow filter, you will need to understand this material.

This section contains the following topics:

-   [Overview of Data Flow in DirectShow](overview-of-data-flow-in-directshow.md)
-   [Transports](transports.md)
-   [Samples and Allocators](samples-and-allocators.md)
-   [Filter States](filter-states.md)
