# Getting Buffers

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

If your filter has a custom allocator that uses filter resources, the allocator's [**IMemAllocator::GetBuffer**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-imemallocator-getbuffer) method should hold the streaming lock, as with other streaming methods:


```C++
HRESULT CMyInputAllocator::GetBuffer(
    IMediaSample **ppBuffer,
    REFERENCE_TIME *pStartTime, 
    REFERENCE_TIME *pEndTime,
    DWORD dwFlags)
{
    CAutoLock cObjectLock(&m_csReceive);

    /* Use resources. */

    return CMemAllocator::GetBuffer(ppBuffer, pStartTime, pEndTime, dwFlags);    
}
```
