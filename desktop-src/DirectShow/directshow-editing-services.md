# DirectShow Editing Services

\[This API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.\]

DirectShow Editing Services (DES) is an application programming interface (API) that greatly simplifies the tasks involved in video editing. DES is built on top of the core DirectShow architecture. It abstracts much of the complexity of DirectShow, and provides a set of interfaces designed specifically for manipulating video editing projects. As an application developer, you get the benefits of DirectShow inside a framework much better suited for creating video editing applications.
