# DirectShow Editing Services

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

\[This API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.\]

DirectShow Editing Services (DES) is an application programming interface (API) that greatly simplifies the tasks involved in video editing. DES is built on top of the core DirectShow architecture. It abstracts much of the complexity of DirectShow, and provides a set of interfaces designed specifically for manipulating video editing projects. As an application developer, you get the benefits of DirectShow inside a framework much better suited for creating video editing applications.
