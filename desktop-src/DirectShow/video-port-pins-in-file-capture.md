# Video Port Pins in File Capture

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

If the capture device has a video port, the video port pin must be connected to a video renderer, even if you only want to capture to a file.

If you call [**ICaptureGraphBuilder2::RenderStream**](/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-icapturegraphbuilder2-renderstream) with the value **PIN\_CATEGORY\_CAPTURE** and the device has a video port pin, the Capture Graph Builder automatically connects the video port pin to the [Overlay Mixer](overlay-mixer-filter.md) filter and connects the Overlay Mixer to the Video Renderer. The Capture Graph Builder hides the video window by calling [**IVideoWindow::put\_AutoShow**](/windows/desktop/api/Control/nf-control-ivideowindow-put_autoshow) with the value **OAFALSE**. If the application later calls **RenderStream** with **PIN\_CATEGORY\_PREVIEW**, the Capture Graph Builder calls **put\_AutoShow** with the value **OATRUE**, in order to show the video window.

After you call **RenderStream** with **PIN\_CATEGORY\_CAPTURE**, you can check whether it has added the Video Renderer by querying the Filter Graph Manager for the [**IVideoWindow**](/windows/desktop/api/Control/nn-control-ivideowindow) interface.
