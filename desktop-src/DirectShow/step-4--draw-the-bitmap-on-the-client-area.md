# Step 4: Draw the Bitmap on the Client Area

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

\[This API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.\]

This topic is Step 4 of [Grabbing a Poster Frame](grabbing-a-poster-frame.md).

The final step is to draw the bitmap onto the client area of the application window, using the [**SetDIBitsToDevice**](/windows/win32/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-setdibitstodevice) function. This example simply paints the bitmap in the upper-left corner of the client area, without regard to the window size:


```C++
case WM_PAINT:
    {
        PAINTSTRUCT ps;
        HDC hdc = BeginPaint(hwnd, &ps);
        if (pbmi)
        {
            int result = SetDIBitsToDevice(hdc, 0, 0, 
                pbmi->biWidth,
                pbmi->biHeight,
                0, 0, 0,
                pbmi->biHeight,
                pBuffer,
                reinterpret_cast<BITMAPINFO*>(pbmi),
                DIB_RGB_COLORS);
        }
        EndPaint(hwnd, &ps);
    }
    break;
```



The *pBuffer* and *pbmi* variables are declared in [Step 1: Create the Windows Framework](step-1--create-the-windows-framework.md), and their values are obtained in [Step 3: Implement the Frame-Grabbing Function](step-3--implement-the-frame-grabbing-function.md).
