# Testing Whether a Graphics Driver Supports COPP

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Certified Output Protection Protocol (COPP) enables an application to protect video content as it travels from the video card to the display device. If a graphics driver supports COPP, the driver holds a certificate chain, signed by Microsoft, authenticating the driver. Playback applications that use COPP to enforce content protection must validate the certificate chain to ensure that the driver has not been tampered with.

However, you might want to check whether a graphics driver supports COPP, without validating the certificate. For example, when a digital media provider issues a digital rights management (DRM) license, it might want to check whether the user has a COPP-enabled graphics driver. The provider does not need to enforce COPP at the time it issues the license; it only needs to test whether the driver supports COPP.

The following code shows how to test whether a driver supports COPP. The application must pass in the name of a video file that will be used to test the driver. This is required because the Video Mixing Renderer filter in Microsoft® DirectShow® does not initialize a COPP session until the filter is connected. This function can be included in a client application to check if the driver is capable of running COPP.

> [!Note]  
> If the user's computer has two graphics cards, this function tests the driver for the primary graphics card, but not the secondary graphics card.

 


```C++
#include <dshow.h>

#define SAFE_RELEASE(p) if (NULL != (p)) { (p)->Release(); (p) = NULL; }

// Name:        IsDriverCoppEnabled
// Description: Test whether the user's graphics driver supports
//              COPP.
// wszTestFile: Name of a video file to use for testing.
//
// If this method returns the value SUPPORTS_COPP, it does *not* guarantee 
// that the driver is a valid COPP-enabled driver. If you want to use COPP 
// to enforce video output protection, the application *must* validate 
// the certificate returned by the KeyExchange method. 
// 
// The purpose of this function is only to test whether the driver 
// claims to support COPP.
