# Rendering Errors

> [!Note]  
> \[Deprecated. This API may be removed from future releases of Windows.\]

 

Microsoft® DirectShow® Editing Services (DES) defines various error codes used to log rendering errors. If a project does not render correctly, the render engine calls the [**IAMErrorLog::LogError**](iamerrorlog-logerror.md) method. The following table summarizes the parameters given to **LogError**:

-   The error code is contained in the *ErrorCode* parameter.
-   The description is contained in the ErrorString parameter.
-   The description is contained in the *ErrorString* parameter.
-   If there is extra information, the **VARIANT** type is contained in the **vt** member of the **VARIANT** pointed to by *pExtraInfo*.

> [!Note]  
> The error codes described here are not **HRESULT** values. For a list of **HRESULT** return values specific to DES, see [Error and Success Codes](error-and-success-codes.md).
