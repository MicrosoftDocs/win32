# IAMTimelineComp::GetCountOfType method

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `GetCountOfType` method retrieves the number of objects of a given type contained in this composition and all its virtual tracks, recursively.

## Syntax


```C++
HRESULT GetCountOfType(
   long                *pVal,
   long                *pValWithComps,
   TIMELINE_MAJOR_TYPE MajorType
);
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*pVal* 
</dt> <dd>

Receives the number of objects of the specified type contained in this composition and all its virtual tracks, recursively.

</dd> <dt>

*pValWithComps* 
</dt> <dd>

Receives the count returned in *pVal* plus the number of compositions searched, including this one.

</dd> <dt>

*MajorType* 
</dt> <dd>

Member of the [**TIMELINE\_MAJOR\_TYPE**](timeline-major-type.md) enumerated type, specifying the type of object to count.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

Returns S\_OK if successful, or E\_POINTER otherwise.

## Remarks

Typically, an application will not call this method. It is called by the render engine.

If you count compositions, the value returned in *pVal* is zero and the value returned in *pValWithComps* is the number of compositions. The value of *\*pValWithComps* includes the composition on which you call the method. For example, if you call this method on an empty composition, *\*pValWithComps* equals 1.

Groups cannot reside inside compositions, so you cannot use this method to count groups. (The returned count will always be zero.) To count groups, call the [**IAMTimeline::GetGroupCount**](iamtimeline-getgroupcount.md) method.
