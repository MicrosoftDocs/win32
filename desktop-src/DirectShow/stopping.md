# Stopping

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **Stop** method must unblock the **Receive** method and decommit the filter's allocators. Decommitting an allocator forces any pending **GetBuffer** calls to return, which unblocks upstream filters that are waiting for samples. The **Stop** method holds the filter lock and then calls the [**CBaseFilter::Stop**](cbasefilter-stop.md) method, which calls [**CBasePin::Inactive**](cbasepin-inactive.md) on all of the filter's pins:


```C++
HRESULT CMyFilter::Stop()
{
    CAutoLock lock_it(m_pLock);
    // Inactivate all the pins, to protect the filter resources.
    hr = CBaseFilter::Stop();

    /* Safe to destroy filter resources used by the streaming thread. */

    return hr;
}
```



Override the input pin's **Inactive** method as follows:


```C++
HRESULT CMyInputPin::Inactive()
{
    // You do not need to hold the filter lock here. 
    // It is already locked in Stop.

    // Unblock Receive.
    SetEvent(m_hSomeEventThatReceiveNeedsToWaitOn);

    // Make sure Receive will fail. 
    // This also decommits the allocator.
    HRESULT hr = CBaseInputPin::Inactive();

    // Make sure Receive has completed, and is not using resources.
    {
        CAutoLock c(&m_csReceive);

        /* It is now safe to destroy filter resources used by the
           streaming thread. */
    }
    return hr;
}
```
