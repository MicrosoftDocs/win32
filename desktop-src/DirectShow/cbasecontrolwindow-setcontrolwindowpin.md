# CBaseControlWindow.SetControlWindowPin method

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `SetControlWindowPin` method sets the pin with which to synchronize.

## Syntax


```C++
void SetControlWindowPin(
   CBasePin *pPin
);
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*pPin* 
</dt> <dd>

Pointer to the pin with which the interface is synchronized.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

No return value.

## Remarks

This member function sets the m\_pPin member variable equal to the pPin parameter. As described in the constructor, the interface can be called only when the filter has been connected successfully. The object is passed in through this member function to the pin with which it should synchronize; in most cases, it will determine if the pin is connected whenever it has an interface method called and will return VFW\_E\_NOT\_CONNECTED if it fails.
