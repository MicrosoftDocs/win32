# International Analog TV Tuning

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This section describes the support for international analog tuning that is provided by the DirectShow [TV Tuner](tv-tuner-filter.md) filter. It contains the following topics:

-   [Frequency Tables](frequency-tables.md)
-   [Frequency Overrides](frequency-overrides.md)
-   [Collecting Fine-Tuning Information](collecting-fine-tuning-information.md)
-   [Tables and Assignments](tables-and-assignments.md)
