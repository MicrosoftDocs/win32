# Unicable Frequency Table

Due to its length, the Unicable table is not included here. The goal behind the Unicable table is to include a comprehensive set of frequencies (basically all other tables combined, plus some real-world observations) in one table to facilitate an automated channel scan without resorting to a linear search of the entire frequency spectrum. For those frequencies that are not included in this table, the consumer will be required to enter a frequency through a custom user interface, resulting in a frequency override entry in the registry.
