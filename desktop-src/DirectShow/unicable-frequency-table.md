# Unicable Frequency Table

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Due to its length, the Unicable table is not included here. The goal behind the Unicable table is to include a comprehensive set of frequencies (basically all other tables combined, plus some real-world observations) in one table to facilitate an automated channel scan without resorting to a linear search of the entire frequency spectrum. For those frequencies that are not included in this table, the consumer will be required to enter a frequency through a custom user interface, resulting in a frequency override entry in the registry.
