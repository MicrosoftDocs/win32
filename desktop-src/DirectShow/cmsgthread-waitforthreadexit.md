# CMsgThread.WaitForThreadExit method

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Blocks until the thread exits.

## Syntax


```C++
BOOL WaitForThreadExit(
   LPDWORD lpdwExitCode
);
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*lpdwExitCode* 
</dt> <dd>

Pointer to the exit code returned by the thread.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

Returns either **TRUE** or **FALSE**, the meaning of which is determined by the class supplying the overridden [**CMsgThread::ThreadMessageProc**](cmsgthread-threadmessageproc.md) member function and the calling member function.

## Remarks

Ensure that the worker thread has exited completely before completing the destruction of your derived class; otherwise, the thread might still execute after your dynamic-link library (DLL) has been unloaded from the address space of the process. Even if the only instruction left to exit is a single-return instruction, this would cause an exception. The only reliable way to ensure that the thread has exited is to signal the thread to exit (using a privately negotiated [**CMsg**](cmsg.md) object sent to the [**CMsgThread::PutThreadMsg**](cmsgthread-putthreadmsg.md) member function) and then call this member function. You should do this in the destructor for your derived class.
