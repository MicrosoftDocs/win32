# AM\_RATE\_CorrectTS Property

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The DVD Navigator uses this property to inform the decoder that the Navigator is setting the correct time stamps on the samples it delivers to the decoder.

## Remarks

Earlier versions of the DVD Navigator did not set the correct time stamps when the playback rate was something other than 1.0. Many decoders work around this problem by ignoring the time stamps during rewind or fast forward, and estimating the correct presentation times.

These problems have been corrected in the current version of the DVD Navigator. For backward compatibility with existing decoders, the DVD Navigator indicates that the time stamps are correct by setting the AM\_RATE\_CorrectTS property on the decoder with the value **TRUE**. When this property is set, the decoder should use the actual time stamps, instead of estimating the presentation times.
