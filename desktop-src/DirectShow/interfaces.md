# DirectShow interfaces

This topic contains reference information for the Microsoft® DirectShow® core interfaces. To provide broad support for various types of hardware, file formats, and stream operations, implements a large number of interfaces. Some are used by applications; others are used internally by filters and other DirectShow components.

The following topic contains an alphabetical list of all the code DirectShow interfaces.

-   [Alphabetical List of DirectShow Interfaces](alphabetical-list-of-directshow-interfaces.md)

Any particular application will use only a small subset of these interfaces. The following topics list interfaces by functional category. Not every interface is listed on these pages, and some interface appear on more than one page.
