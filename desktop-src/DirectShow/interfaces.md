# DirectShow interfaces

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This topic contains reference information for the Microsoft® DirectShow® core interfaces. To provide broad support for various types of hardware, file formats, and stream operations, implements a large number of interfaces. Some are used by applications; others are used internally by filters and other DirectShow components.

The following topic contains an alphabetical list of all the code DirectShow interfaces.

-   [Alphabetical List of DirectShow Interfaces](alphabetical-list-of-directshow-interfaces.md)

Any particular application will use only a small subset of these interfaces. The following topics list interfaces by functional category. Not every interface is listed on these pages, and some interface appear on more than one page.
