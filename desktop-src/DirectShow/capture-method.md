The `Capture` method captures a still image from the video frame when the MSWebDVD object is in windowless mode.

``` syntax
MSWebDVD.Capture()
```

## Remarks

This method captures the current frame from the DVD-Video image and pastes it into a window from which the user can save or edit the image. The MSWebDVD object must be in windowless mode for this method to succeed.
