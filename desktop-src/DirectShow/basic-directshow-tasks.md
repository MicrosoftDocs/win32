# Basic DirectShow Tasks

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This section describes some basic tasks in DirectShow. These tasks are relevant in many application scenarios; they are not specific to any one domain. This section contains the following topics:

-   [Video Rendering](video-rendering.md)
-   [Responding to Events](responding-to-events.md)
-   [Enumerating Devices and Filters](enumerating-devices-and-filters.md)
-   [Enumerating Objects in a Filter Graph](enumerating-objects-in-a-filter-graph.md)
-   [General Graph-Building Techniques](general-graph-building-techniques.md)
-   [Seeking the Filter Graph](seeking-the-filter-graph.md)
-   [Setting the Graph Clock](setting-the-graph-clock.md)
