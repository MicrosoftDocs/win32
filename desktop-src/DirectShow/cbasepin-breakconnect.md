# CBasePin.BreakConnect method

The `BreakConnect` method releases the pin from a connection.

## Syntax


```C++
virtual HRESULT BreakConnect();
```



## Parameters

This method has no parameters.

## Return value

Returns S\_OK.

## Remarks

This method is called during pin disconnection by the [**CBasePin::Disconnect**](cbasepin-disconnect.md) method. It is also called during a connection attempt if the [**CBasePin::CheckConnect**](cbasepin-checkconnect.md) method fails.

This method must free any resources that were obtained by the **CheckConnect** method. For example, if **CheckConnect** allocates memory, `BreakConnect` should free the memory. If **CheckConnect** queries the connecting pin for an interface, `BreakConnect` should free the interface.

Note that `BreakConnect` can be called without a corresponding call to **CompleteConnect**. Therefore, you cannot assume that **CompleteConnect** has been called previously.
