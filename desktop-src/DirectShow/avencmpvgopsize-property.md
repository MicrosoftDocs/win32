# AVEncMPVGOPSize property

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Specifies the maximum number of pictures from one group-of-pictures (GOP) header to the next GOP header.

This property is read/write.

## Data type

**UINT32** (**VT\_UI4**)

## Property GUID

**CODECAPI\_AVEncMPVGOPSize**

## Property value

Encoders can implement this property as an enumerated set or as a linear range.

## Remarks

Set this property before starting a recording.

**Applies to Windows 8:** The encoded GOP size shall be smaller than or equal to the specified number through this property, in order to keep the same B frame pattern set by [CODECAPI\_AVEncMPVDefaultBPictureCount](avencmpvdefaultbpicturecount-property.md) throughout the GOP or due to scene change. For example, when the number of B frames in a GOP is specified to be 2, and GOP size is 11, then encoder shall produce GOP size of 10 frames or less. When scene change happens in the middle of a GOP, encoder might also insert key frame and produce smaller GOP.

GOP size 0 is encoder dependent and encoders can choose different GOP sizes based on their implementation/quality/performance. Encoders should honor the GOP size and truncate B frames in this case.
