# IAMTimelineComp interface

> [!Note]  
> \[Deprecated. This API may be removed from future releases of Windows.\]

 

The **IAMTimelineComp** interface inserts or retrieves virtual tracks on a composition in [DirectShow Editing Services](directshow-editing-services.md) (DES).

A composition is a collection of layers that acts as a single, composited *track*. For example, a composition that contains two tracks with a transition between them acts as a single track with the transition precomposited. A composition should contain media of only one type (such as audio or video), but this limitation is not enforced. A *virtual track* is any object that can reside in a composition, including tracks and other compositions.

The topmost nodes in the timeline are *groups*. Groups implement both the `IAMTimelineComp` interface and the [**IAMTimelineGroup**](iamtimelinegroup.md) interface.

To create a composition object, call [**IAMTimeline::CreateEmptyNode**](iamtimeline-createemptynode.md) with the value TIMELINE\_MAJOR\_TYPE\_COMPOSITE. You can query the returned [**IAMTimelineObj**](iamtimelineobj.md) pointer for the `IAMTimelineComp` interface. For more information, see [The Timeline Model](the-timeline-model.md) and [Constructing a Timeline](constructing-a-timeline.md).

## Members

The **IAMTimelineComp** interface inherits from the [**IUnknown**](/windows/win32/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown) interface. **IAMTimelineComp** also has these types of members:
