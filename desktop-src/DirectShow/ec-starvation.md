# EC\_STARVATION

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

A filter is not receiving enough data.

## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

<span id="lParam1"></span><span id="lparam1"></span><span id="LPARAM1"></span>*lParam1*
</dt> <dd>

Zero.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="lParam2"></span><span id="lparam2"></span><span id="LPARAM2"></span>*lParam2*
</dt> <dd>

Zero.

</dd> </dl>

## Default Action

The event is not sent to the application. If the filter graph is running, the filter graph manager pauses the graph and waits for the pause to complete. Then it runs the graph again. The filter sending the event should not complete its transition to paused until it has enough data to resume. If the filter graph is not running, the filter graph manager ignores this event.

## Remarks

A parser or source filter can send this event if too little data is arriving.
