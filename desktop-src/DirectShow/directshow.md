# DirectShow

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The Microsoft DirectShow application programming interface (API) is a media-streaming architecture for Microsoft Windows. Using DirectShow, your applications can perform high-quality video and audio playback or capture.

The DirectShow headers, libraries, SDK tools, and samples are available in the [Windows SDK](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/aa904949.aspx).

> [!Note]  
> Previous versions of the DirectShow SDK were included in the DirectX SDK. The last version of the DirectX SDK to include DirectShow was DirectX 9.0 SDK Update - (February 2005) Extras. After this version, DirectShow was moved to the Windows SDK. To get the latest version of the DirectShow headers, libraries, and samples, download the Windows SDK.
