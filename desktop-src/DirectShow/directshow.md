# DirectShow

The Microsoft DirectShow application programming interface (API) is a media-streaming architecture for Microsoft Windows. Using DirectShow, your applications can perform high-quality video and audio playback or capture.

The DirectShow headers, libraries, SDK tools, and samples are available in the [Windows SDK](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/aa904949.aspx).

> [!Note]  
> Previous versions of the DirectShow SDK were included in the DirectX SDK. The last version of the DirectX SDK to include DirectShow was DirectX 9.0 SDK Update - (February 2005) Extras. After this version, DirectShow was moved to the Windows SDK. To get the latest version of the DirectShow headers, libraries, and samples, download the Windows SDK.
