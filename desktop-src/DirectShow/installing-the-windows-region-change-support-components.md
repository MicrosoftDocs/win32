# Installing the Windows Region Change Support Components

Application developers can utilize the DVD region change support built into Windows to change region inside the DVD playback applications.

On Windows 2000 and later, the component that provides the DVD region change support is in the DLL storprop.dll (available in %windir%\\system32). This DLL is installed by default and no extra steps are required to ensure that this DLL is available.
