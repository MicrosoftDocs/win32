# Step 10. Support COM Registration

The last remaining task is to support COM registration, so that the property frame can create new instances of your property page. Add another [**CFactoryTemplate**](cfactorytemplate.md) entry to the global *g\_Templates* array, which is used to register all of the COM objects in your DLL. Do not include any filter set-up information for the property page.


```C++
const AMOVIESETUP_FILTER FilterSetupData = 
{ 
    /* Not shown ... */
};

CFactoryTemplate g_Templates[] =
{   
    // This entry is for the filter.
    {
        wszName,
        &CLSID_GrayFilter,
        CGrayFilter::CreateInstance,
        NULL,
        &FilterSetupData 
    },
    // This entry is for the property page.
    { 
        L"Saturation Props",
        &CLSID_SaturationProp,
        CGrayProp::CreateInstance, 
        NULL, NULL
    }
};
```



If you declare *g\_cTemplates* as shown in the following code, then it automatically has the correct value based on the array size:


```C++
int g_cTemplates = sizeof(g_Templates)/sizeof(g_Templates[0]);
```



Also, add a static `CreateInstance` method to the property page class. You can name the method anything that you prefer, but the signature must match the one shown the following example:


```C++
static CUnknown * WINAPI CreateInstance(LPUNKNOWN pUnk, HRESULT *pHr) 
{
    CGrayProp *pNewObject = new CGrayProp(pUnk);
    if (pNewObject == NULL) 
    {
        *pHr = E_OUTOFMEMORY;
    }
    return pNewObject;
} 
```



To test the property page, register the DLL and then load the filter in GraphEdit. Right-click the filter and select **Filter Properties**.
