# EC\_NEED\_RESTART

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

A filter is requesting that the graph be restarted.

## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

<span id="lParam1"></span><span id="lparam1"></span><span id="LPARAM1"></span>*lParam1*
</dt> <dd>

Zero.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="lParam2"></span><span id="lparam2"></span><span id="LPARAM2"></span>*lParam2*
</dt> <dd>

Zero.

</dd> </dl>

## Default Action

The filter graph manager pauses and restarts the graph. It does not pass the event to the application.

## Remarks

If a filter rejects a sample in the middle of a stream, the upstream pin will stop delivering samples. The filter can restart the stream by sending this event. For example, the audio renderer might lose access to the sound device, because a video window has lost focus. At that point, the audio renderer starts rejecting samples. When it regains access to the sound device, it sends this event to restart the audio stream.
