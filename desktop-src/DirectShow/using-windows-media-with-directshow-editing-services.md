# Using Windows Media With DirectShow Editing Services

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

\[This API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.\]

This section describes how to use Windows Media–based content in a [DirectShow Editing Services](directshow-editing-services.md) (DES) application. There are two main scenarios:

-   Source clips. A DES project can contain audio and video clips from Windows Media files.
-   Target format. Windows Media is an ideal format for the final output of a video editing project.

To work with Windows Media files, the application must provide a software certificate, also called a key. It does this by implementing a key provider object. The key provider is a COM object the exposes the **IServiceProvider** interface. For information about implementing the key provider, see [Unlocking the Windows Media Format SDK](unlocking-the-windows-media-format-sdk.md).

To use DES with Windows Media files, the following DES objects require the software key:

-   The render engine, for previewing or file writing.
-   The MediaDet object, to get video frames or media types from ASF files.
-   ![Important]  
    > Do not use the Smart Render Engine to read or write Windows Media files. Always use the Basic Render Engine (CLSID\_RenderEngine).

     

To give an object the software key, query that object for the **IObjectWithSite** interface and call **IObjectWithSite::SetSite** with a pointer to your key provider. For example, the following code provides the software key to the render engine:


```C++
// Create your key provider, using an application-defined function:
IServiceProvider *pKey;
hr = MyCreateKeyProviderFunction(&pKey);  

// Query the Render Engine for IObjectWithSite.
IObjectWithSite *pOWS;
hr = pRenderEngine->QueryInterface(__uuidof(IObjectWithSite), 
    reinterpret_cast<void**>(&pOWS));
if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
{
    // Give it your key provider.
    hr = pOWS->SetSite(pKey);
    pOWS->Release();
}
pKey->Release();
```



To use Windows Media source clips in a DES project, simply call **IObjectWithSite::SetSite** on the render engine with a pointer to your key provider.
