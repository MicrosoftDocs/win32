# Getting started (DirectShow)

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer) and [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine). **MediaPlayer** and **IMFMediaEngine** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** and **IMFMediaEngine** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This section contains articles covering basic DirectShow concepts needed for application development. You can use this section as a high-level introduction to DirectShow. You need only a general understanding of programming and media to understand the topics in this section.
