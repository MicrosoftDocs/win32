# DV Data in the AVI File Format

Microsoft has specified the format for storage of digital video (DV) data in AVI files. Conforming to this specification will ensure that the AVI files authored in this format will be compatible with future versions of the DirectShow digital video architecture for the Windowsplatform.

This article describes the format of AVI files containing DV data. Specific FOURCCs (four-character codes) for interleaved DV data streams and DV compressor/decompressor stream handlers are defined. The stream format structure for DV data is defined. Specifications for two methods of storing DV data in the AVI file format are specified.

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the DV data format. (This format is defined in the *Specification of Consumer-use Digital VCRs*, also called the Blue Book.)

There are two types of DV AVI files: AVI files that contain one DV data stream, called *type-1* files; and AVI files that contain DV video as a 'vids' stream and DV audio as 'auds' streams, called *type-2* files.

**AVI Files Containing One DV Data Stream (Type-1)**

Interleaved DV data can be stored in its native format as a single stream within an AVI RIFF file. This has the advantage of using the minimum amount of data storage for DV. The primary disadvantage is that this file format is not backward-compatible with Video for Windows, because it doesn't contain either a video 'vids' or an audio 'auds' stream. Support is provided for the interleaved DV stream through the [DV Muxer](dv-muxer-filter.md) and [DV Splitter](dv-splitter-filter.md) filters provided with DirectShow.

DV data can be stored in a single stream within an AVI RIFF file by specifying the 'iavs' (interleaved audio and video stream) FOURCC (four-character code) in the **fccType** member and either of the 'dvsd', 'dvhd', or 'dvsl' FOURCCs in the **fccHandler** member of the 'strh' stream header chunk. The frames per second of the video stream must be specified in the **dwRate** and **dwScale** members and the total number of video blocks in the 'movi' chunk in the **dwLength** member.

The 'dvsd' stream handler FOURCC specifies that the DV data is as defined in Part 2 of the *Specification of Consumer-use Digital VCRs*. Video is in the format of 525 lines at 29.97 Hz (525-60) or 625 lines at 25.00 Hz (625-50).

The 'dvhd' stream handler FOURCC specifies that the DV data is as defined in Part 3 of the *Specification of Consumer-use Digital VCRs*. Video is in the format of 1125 lines at 30.00 Hz (1125-60) or 1250 lines at 25.00 Hz (1250-50).

The 'dvsl' stream handler FOURCC specifies that the DV data is as defined in Part 6 of *Specification of Consumer-use Digital VCRs*. Video is in the format of high-compression SD (SDL).

> [!Note]  
> The remainder of this article provides definitions for 'dvsd' streams.

 

The stream header chunk must be followed by a [**DVINFO**](/windows/desktop/api/strmif/ns-strmif-dvinfo) stream format chunk.

The actual DV data is stored as '\#\#dc' chunks in the 'movi' chunk (the \#\# in the format represents the stream identifier). Each chunk contains one frame of data, either 10 or 12 DV DIF sequences for 525-60 or 625-50 systems, respectively. The DV SD ('dvsd') DIF sequence format is defined in Part 2 of the *Specification of Consumer-use Digital VCRs*.

The following example shows the AIFF RIFF form for an AVI file with one DV data stream, expanded with completed header chunks.

**AVI Files Containing DV Video and DV Audio Streams (Type-2)**

Interleaved DV data can be split into a video stream and one to four audio streams within an AVI RIFF file. This has the advantage of being backward-compatible with Video for Windows, because it contains a standard video 'vids' stream and at least one standard audio 'auds' stream The primary disadvantage is that this file format requires the audio data to be redundantly stored as audio streams. The "video" stream is actually the native interleaved DV data stream. However, as a standard 'vids' stream with a handler type of 'dvsd', the [DV Video Decoder](dv-video-decoder-filter.md) is used. This format also requires using the [DV Splitter](dv-splitter-filter.md) filter to split "captured" files before writing them as AVI files.

DV data can be stored as a video stream with a separate number of audio streams in an AVI RIFF file. The video stream is specified with a standard video stream header (the **fccType** member value is 'vids'). The **fccHandler** member is specified as 'dvsd', 'dvhd', or 'dvsl'. The frames per second of the video stream must be specified in the **dwRate** and **dwScale** members and the total number of video blocks in the 'movi' chunk in the **dwLength** member.

In this AVI file containing DV video as a 'vids' stream and DV audio as 'auds' streams form of DV, the video stream format chunk is a standard [**BITMAPINFOHEADER**](/windows/win32/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-bitmapinfoheader) structure. The stream format chunk can be optionally extended to include the [**DVINFO**](/windows/desktop/api/strmif/ns-strmif-dvinfo) chunk, by increasing the stream format chunk size from 40 bytes (size of the **BITMAPINFOHEADER** structure) to 72 bytes (size of **BITMAPINFOHEADER** plus **DVINFO** structures) and immediately following the **BITMAPINFOHEADER** data structure with a **DVINFO** data structure.

The audio stream(s) is specified with a standard audio stream header (the **fccType** member value is 'auds'). The **fccHandler** member is not used for audio streams.

The DV video data is stored as '\#\#dc' chunks, as defined in the preceding description of an AVI file with one DV data, and the audio data is stored as '\#\#wb' chunks in the 'movi' chunk.

> The *Specification of Consumer-use Digital VCRs* may not be available in some languages and countries.
