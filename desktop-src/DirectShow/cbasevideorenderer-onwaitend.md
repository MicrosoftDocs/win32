# CBaseVideoRenderer.OnWaitEnd method

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The OnWaitEnd method is called when a wait time ends.

## Syntax


```C++
void OnWaitEnd();
```



## Parameters

This method has no parameters.

## Return value

This method does not return a value.

## Remarks

This member function does only performance logging. It is called when the thread is awoken from waiting in the window, or when the next sample is due to be rendered. It could eventually be used to gather information that controls synchronization.
