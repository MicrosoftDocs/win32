# IAMTimelineObj::FixTimes2 method

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

> [!Note]  
> \[Deprecated. This API may be removed from future releases of Windows.\]

 

The `FixTimes2` method rounds the specified start and stop times to the nearest frame boundaries, as defined by the parent group's frame rate setting. This method is equivalent to [**IAMTimelineObj::FixTimes**](iamtimelineobj-fixtimes.md), but takes [**REFTIME**](reftime.md) values.

## Syntax


```C++
HRESULT FixTimes2(
   REFTIME *pStart,
   REFTIME *pStop
);
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*pStart* 
</dt> <dd>

Pointer to a variable that contains the start time, in seconds. If the call succeeds, this variable is set to the rounded time.

</dd> <dt>

*pStop* 
</dt> <dd>

Pointer to a variable that contains the stop time, in seconds. If the call succeeds, this variable is set to the rounded time.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

Returns S\_OK if successful, or E\_NOTINTREE if the object is not part of a group.
