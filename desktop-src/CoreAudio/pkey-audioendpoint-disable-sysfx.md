# PKEY\_AudioEndpoint\_Disable\_SysFx

The **PKEY\_AudioEndpoint\_Disable\_SysFx** property specifies whether system effects are enabled in the shared-mode stream that flows to or from the audio endpoint device.

System effects are implemented as audio processing objects (APOs) that can be inserted into an audio stream. APOs are software modules that perform audio processing functions such as volume control and format conversion. Disabling the system effects for an endpoint device enables the associated stream to pass through the APOs unmodified.

For more information about system effects implemented as APOs, see  [Windows Audio Processing Objects](/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/windows-audio-processing-objects).

This property applies only to the local-effects and global-effects APOs that were installed by the .inf file that installed the audio adapter to which the endpoint device is connected. In addition, this property affects only the target endpoint device—it has no effect on the system effects for any other endpoint devices, even if they connect to the same adapter.

The **vt** member of the **PROPVARIANT** structure is set to **VT\_UI4**.

The **ulVal** member of the **PROPVARIANT** structure is set to **ENDPOINT\_SYSFX\_ENABLED** if system effects are enabled or to **ENDPOINT\_SYSFX\_DISABLED** if they are disabled.
