# Event and Error Handling Under VSS

VSS provides a well-defined error handling mechanism to allow developers and administrators to manage the system and handle errors:

-   [Determining Writer Status](determining-writer-status.md)
-   [VSS Error Logging](vss-error-logging.md)
-   [Writer Errors and Vetoes](writer-errors-and-vetoes.md)
-   [Aborting VSS Operations](aborting-vss-operations.md)
-   [Handling BackupShutdown Events](handling-backupshutdown-events.md)
