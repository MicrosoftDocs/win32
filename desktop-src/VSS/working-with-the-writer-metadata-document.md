# Working with the Writer Metadata Document

Each writer produces a Writer Metadata Document. The backup application uses this document to get information about that writer, the data it owns, and how to restore that data. Once the writer produces it, the Writer Metadata Document is a read-only document to the backup application.

To use the Writer Metadata Document requires that you understand the following:

-   [Writer Metadata Document Life Cycle](writer-metadata-document-life-cycle.md)
-   [Writer Metadata Document Contents](writer-metadata-document-contents.md)
