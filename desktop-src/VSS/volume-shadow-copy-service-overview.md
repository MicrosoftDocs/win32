# Volume Shadow Copy Service Overview

The Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) is a set of COM APIs that implements a framework to allow volume backups to be performed while applications on a system continue to write to the volumes.

VSS provides a consistent interface that allows coordination between user applications that update data on disk ([*writers*](vssgloss-w.md)) and those that back up applications ([*requesters*](vssgloss-r.md)).
