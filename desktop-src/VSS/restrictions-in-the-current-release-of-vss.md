# Restrictions in Windows Server 2003

Certain functionality planned for the Windows Server 2003 release of VSS is not fully supported:

-   During backup operations, multiple instances of a given writer class are allowed only if only one of those instances has a writer restore state (see [**VSS\_WRITERRESTORE\_ENUM**](/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/ne-vswriter-vss_writerrestore_enum)) other than VSS\_WRE\_NEVER. If this condition is met, all writer instances will participate fully during the backup, generating Writer Metadata Documents and participating in event handling.
-   During restore operations, only one writer will receive restore events generated by the requester. If more than one instance of a writer class has a writer restore state set to something other than VSS\_WRE\_NEVER, only one instance will receive restore events. Which instance will receive them is indeterminate.
