# Non-Default Backup and Restore Locations

Backup and restore operations typically copy files from a given, default location on disk to backup media and then restore from that media to the same default location on disk.

There are many reasons, particularly when dealing with running processes, not to follow this simple model. VSS supports using nonstandard sources for backup and alternate destinations for restore, and includes mechanisms to work with subsets of files and to remap files.
