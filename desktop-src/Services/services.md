# Services (Services)

A *service application* conforms to the interface rules of the Service Control Manager (SCM). It can be started automatically at system boot, by a user through the Services control panel applet, or by an application that uses the [service functions](service-functions.md). Services can execute even when no user is logged on to the system.

A *driver service* conforms to the device driver protocols. It is similar to a service application, but it does not interact with the SCM. For simplicity, the term *service* refers to a *service application* in this overview.

Triggers can now be used to control service start. For more info, see [Service Configuration](service-configuration.md).
