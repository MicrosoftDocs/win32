# Local License Store

When a DRM license is delivered to the client computer it is put into the local license store. This is a protected file on the hard disk that contains all the licenses issued to the user along with other DRM information.

You can manipulate data in the local license store in a few, limited ways by using the Windows Media DRM Client Extended APIs.

In addition to the local license store, some objects make use of a temporary license store. A license in a temporary store exists only for a short period of time. However, some licenses that begin in a temporary store can be saved to the regular local license store.
