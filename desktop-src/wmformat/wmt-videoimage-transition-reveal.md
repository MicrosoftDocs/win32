# WMT\_VIDEOIMAGE\_TRANSITION\_REVEAL

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Format 11 SDK](/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Source Reader](/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader) and [Sink Writer](/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer). **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** instead of **Windows Media Format 11 SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The reveal transition reveals the new image along a straight line originating from one side of the frame.

## Parameters

The following table describes the parameters used by this transition and lists the members of the [**WMT\_VIDEOIMAGE\_SAMPLE2**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/ns-wmsdkidl-wmt_videoimage_sample2) structure to which they are assigned.




| Parameter | Structure member | Description | 
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Distance | <strong>fEffectPara0</strong> | Amount of the new image revealed, in pixels. This value is relative to the originating side of the frame. | 
| Direction | <strong>fEffectPara1</strong> | Direction of the revealing.Set to one of the following values:<br /><ul><li>0 - Reveal to the right; originate from the left side of the frame.</li><li>1 - Reveal to the left; originate from the right side of the frame.</li><li>2 - Reveal upward; originate from the bottom of the frame.</li><li>3 - Reveal downward; originate from the top of the frame.</li></ul> | 
| Composition | <strong>fEffectPara2</strong> | Set to one of the following values:<ul><li>0 - Specifies normal composition, in which the previous image is the background, and the current image is the foreground.</li><li>1 - Specifies reversed composition, in which the current image is the background image, and the previous image is the foreground</li></ul> |
