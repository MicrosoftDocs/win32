# Working with Metadata

Metadata support is provided by the writer object, the reader and synchronous reader objects, and the metadata editor object. For general information about metadata, see [Metadata](metadata.md). For information about the features supporting metadata in the Windows Media Format SDK, see [Metadata Features](metadata-features.md).

The interface for metadata editing is [**IWMHeaderInfo3**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmheaderinfo3), which you can obtain by calling the **QueryInterface** method of any interface in one of the objects listed above. **IWMHeaderInfo3** inherits the methods of [**IWMHeaderInfo**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmheaderinfo) and [**IWMHeaderInfo2**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmheaderinfo2). The methods of **IWMHeaderInfo3** that deal with metadata attributes represent a different approach to accessing metadata than that used by the methods of **IWMHeaderInfo**. You should always use the newer methods.

Metadata in an ASF file is identified by an index and a stream number. File-level attributes are assigned a stream number of 0. In previous versions of the Windows Media Format SDK, attributes could be identified by name. However, because you can now duplicate attribute names within a stream, this is no longer possible. Instead, you can retrieve all the indexes matching a name. For more information, see [Retrieving Metadata Attributes](retrieving-metadata-attributes.md).

To aid in finding attributes quickly, you can use a special stream number, 0xFFFF. Use this stream number to identify the file as a whole, rather than a specific stream or the file-level attributes. The objects of the Windows Media Format SDK maintain separate indexes for each stream and for the file-level attributes. When using stream 0xFFFF, the indexes are different from those you use when specifying a specific stream. For example, the attribute that is index 0 for stream 0 will not be the same as the attribute that is index 0 for stream 0xFFFF.

The following sections describe the use of metadata in greater detail.

Several of the sample applications show how to retrieve and edit metadata. In particular, see the MetadataEdit sample, which comes in both C++ and C# versions.
