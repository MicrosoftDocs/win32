# License Revocation (Windows Media Format SDK)

The Windows Media Format SDK provides methods by which an application can interact with a license issuer's Web site to revoke a content license.

A typical scenario for license revocation is when a user gives an old computer to someone else. In this case, the original user may have many licenses for protected content stored on the computer even though that user no longer uses the computer. License revocation enables the original user to remove the licenses from the computer.

The license revocation process involves messages being passed back and forth between the client application and a Web-based application created by the license issuer.

**Note** DRM is not supported by the x64-based version of this SDK.
