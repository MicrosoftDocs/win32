# Microsoft Windows Media DRM Client Sample Applications

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Format 11 SDK](/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Source Reader](/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader) and [Sink Writer](/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer). **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** instead of **Windows Media Format 11 SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The sample applications that use the Windows Media DRM Client Extended APIs are provided as projects for Microsoft Visual Studio 2005.

The following table summarizes the samples. Additional information about each sample, including usage information, can be found in the readme.txt file in each sample directory.
