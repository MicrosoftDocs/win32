# WM/ProviderStyle

The **WM/ProviderStyle** attribute contains the style of the file as assigned by the metadata content provider.

## Global Constant

g\_wszWMProviderStyle

## Data Type

## Remarks

This attribute is essentially a second genre designation. Because different classifiers have different notions of the genres associated with content, the provider style may be different than the genre assigned by the content creator.
