# Library Files, Header Files, and Compiler Settings

The programming components of the Windows Media DRM Client Extended APIs are defined in the wmdrmsdk.h header file, and implemented in the wmdrmsdk.lib and mfuuid.lib libraries.

Some of the functionality of the Windows Media DRM Client Extended APIs requires that you obtain a protected library from Microsoft. This library, called the stub library in this documentation, is specific to the recipient and specifies the application security level for your applications. The stub library replaces wmdrmsdk.lib; you should never link to both.

**Note** The DRM stub library is separate from the stub library used by the rest of the Windows Media Format SDK but is licensed using the same method.

**Note** The DRM stub library must be linked into your application after the library file msvcrt.lib to avoid linker errors.

The stub library contains an embedded certificate which can be revoked by Microsoft if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of the license agreement.

Specific methods that require the stub library are labeled in the documentation. If you try to use such a method without linking to the stub library, it will return an NS\_E\_DRM\_STUBLIB\_REQUIRED error.

The DRM subsystem can not be used in a debug build. If this is attempted, methods of the API will return the NS\_E\_DRM\_DEBUGGING\_NOT\_ALLOWED error.
