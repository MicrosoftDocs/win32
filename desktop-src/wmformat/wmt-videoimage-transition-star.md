# WMT\_VIDEOIMAGE\_TRANSITION\_STAR

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Format 11 SDK](/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Source Reader](/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader) and [Sink Writer](/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer). **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** instead of **Windows Media Format 11 SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The star transition reveals the new image in a five-pointed star inside the frame.

## Parameters

The following table describes the parameters used by this transition and lists the members of the [**WMT\_VIDEOIMAGE\_SAMPLE2**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/ns-wmsdkidl-wmt_videoimage_sample2) structure to which they are assigned.




| Parameter | Structure member | Description | 
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Center X | <strong>fEffectPara0</strong> | X-coordinate, relative to the video frame, of the center of the star. | 
| Center Y | <strong>fEffectPara1</strong> | Y-coordinate, relative to the video frame, of the center of the star. | 
| Radius | <strong>fEffectPara2</strong> | Radius, in pixels, of the circle defined by the points of the star. | 
| Composition | <strong>fEffectPara3</strong> | Set to one of the following values:<ul><li>0 - Specifies normal composition, in which the previous image is the background, and the current image is the foreground.</li><li>1 - Specifies reversed composition, in which the current image is the background image, and the previous image is the foreground.</li></ul> |
