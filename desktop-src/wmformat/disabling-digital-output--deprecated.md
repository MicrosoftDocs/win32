# Disabling Digital Output (deprecated)

This page documents a feature that will be supported with a different technical solution in future versions of Windows.

Another feature of Microsoft Secure Audio Path is the ability to disable digital output. Certain sound cards provide a way to send digital output from a hardware device; these devices might be certified and will pass authorization from the DRM kernel component. So, if a legitimate sound card has digital output enabled, people can still capture a perfect digital recording of protected music.

This feature lets content owners or license issuers disable digital output by setting a parameter in licenses for their music. If this parameter is set, the sound card disables its digital output capability when playing protected music. Users can listen to decrypted music, but they cannot make copies.
