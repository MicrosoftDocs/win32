# Using System Profiles

The system profiles included with the Windows Media Format SDK were designed to cover the basic needs of digital media content comprised of audio and video. Because of the great variety of features now available, and the related increase in possible digital media scenarios, system profiles have been deemphasized. The most recent set of system profiles make use of the version 8 Windows Media codecs which were released with Windows XP. Despite not supporting the latest version of the codecs, the system profiles make an excellent starting point for creating profiles to suit your needs.

The following topics describe how to use system profiles as the basis for your ASF files.
