# Playlist Burning

Windows Media DRM 10 licenses can support copying playlists of protected files to Red Book audio CD. License issuers can limit the number of times content can be copied to CD in a playlist by a total number of times and by the number of times a specific playlist can be copied. For more information about playlist burning rights in licenses, see the Windows Media Rights Manager 10 SDK documentation.

The Windows Media Format SDK provides the ability to quickly check all of the files in a playlist to ensure that they are licensed for playlist burning.

**Note** DRM is not supported by the x64-based version of this SDK.
