# Importing and Exporting DRM Protected Content

One of the primary roles of the new Windows Media DRM Client Extended APIs is to enable the import and export of DRM-protected content to third-party rights management systems.

The primary challenge of importing and exporting protected data in your application is to robustly share ASF data samples between your system and the DRM subsystem. When your application handles data samples it has to assure that certain robustness standards are met to avoid the potential for the protection mechanism to be circumvented. These standards are outlined in the robustness and compliance rules that you agree to when you license DRM.
