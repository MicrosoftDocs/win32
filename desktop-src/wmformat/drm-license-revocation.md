# License Revocation (Microsoft Windows Media DRM Client)

License revocation refers to the removal of licenses from a local license store. A common scenario for license revocation occurs when a service provider, such as a music subscription service, must deactivate the service on a user's computer.

The license revocation process is initiated by a service provided by the license issuer. Your application can host this service or it can be a Web application. In either case, your application must be able to receive a license challenge created by the service.

To remove licenses from the license store, do the following:

1.  Upon receiving a license challenge from the license issuer, create a revocation challenge using the [**IWMDRMLicenseManagement::CreateLicenseRevocationChallenge**](iwmdrmlicensemanagement-createlicenserevocationchallenge.md) method. This method will allocate a buffer containing a revocation challenge data, which is passed to your application through the *ppbChallengeOutput* parameter.
2.  Send the license revocation challenge to a license revocation service. The server will generate a license revocation BLOB (LRB) in response.
3.  Remove the license from the local store using the [**IWMDRMLicenseManagement::ProcessLicenseRevocationResponse**](iwmdrmlicensemanagement-processlicenserevocationresponse.md) method, passing the LRB returned by license server.
4.  Deallocate the buffer allocated by **CreateLicenseRevocationChallenge** by using the **CoTaskMemFree** function.

For more information on how license revocation works or on how to write a revocation service, see [Implementing License Revocation](/documentation/?url=%2flibrary%2fwmrm10%2fhtm%2fhowlicenserevokationworks.asp).
