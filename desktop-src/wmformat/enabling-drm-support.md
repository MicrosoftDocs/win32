# Enabling DRM Support

You can use the Microsoft Windows Media Format Software Development Kit (SDK) to build applications that can apply digital rights management (DRM) protection and play live-DRM streams or DRM-protected files. Support is also provided for backing up and restoring a player's DRM licenses, and for [*individualizing*](wmformat-glossary.md) players.

This documentation assumes that you have a basic familiarity with Microsoft's digital rights management technology. A basic overview of Windows Media DRM is provided in the [Digital Rights Management Features](digital-rights-management-features.md) section of this documentation. For more information on DRM, see the Digital Rights Management page at the [Microsoft Web site](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows/products/windows-media).

> [!Note]  
> DRM is not supported by the x64-based version of this SDK.

 

The following sections describe how to enable DRM support.

The SDK includes several sample applications that demonstrate how to read protected files; the fullest example is DRMShow. For more information, see [Sample Applications](sample-applications.md).
