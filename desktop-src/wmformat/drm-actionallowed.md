# DRM\_ActionAllowed

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Format 11 SDK](/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Source Reader](/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader) and [Sink Writer](/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer). **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** instead of **Windows Media Format 11 SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **DRM\_ActionAllowed** property is the base string for the other "ActionAllowed" property string constants, such as DRM\_ActionAllowed\_CopyToCD, Because the "action allowed" property is not extensible, this base string is of no use to applications.

## Global Constant
