# WM/EncodingSettings

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Format 11 SDK](/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Source Reader](/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader) and [Sink Writer](/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer). **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** instead of **Windows Media Format 11 SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **WM/EncodingSettings** attribute contains the settings used to encode the content.

## Global Constant

g\_wszWMEncodingSettings

## Data Type

**WMT\_TYPE\_STRING**

## Remarks

There is no standard format for indicating encoding settings. However, it is preferable to describe the encoding settings in English rather than including a dump of the settings.
