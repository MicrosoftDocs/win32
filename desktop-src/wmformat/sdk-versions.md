# SDK Versions

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Format 11 SDK](/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Source Reader](/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader) and [Sink Writer](/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer). **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** instead of **Windows Media Format 11 SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This documentation covers the Windows Media Format 7 SDK through the Windows Media Format 11 SDK. Individual methods, structures, functions, and enumerations include version requirements in their reference topics.

The Windows Media Format 11 SDK is supported on Windows Vista and Windows XP only.

The Windows Media Format 9.5 SDK is supported only on Windows XP. If you write an application based on the Windows Media Format 9.5 SDK, your application will not run on any other operating system.

A few features of the Windows Media Format 9 Series SDK also require Windows XP. The individual reference topics relating to those features call out that requirement.
