# Features

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Format 11 SDK](/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Source Reader](/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader) and [Sink Writer](/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer). **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** instead of **Windows Media Format 11 SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The Windows Media Format SDK provides many options for dealing with ASF files and other files using the Advanced Systems Format. Many of these features are not easily classified in one of the major functions of the SDK. This section describes the features of the Windows Media Format SDK from a programming perspective. Each feature topic gives an overview of the feature and provides links to related topics in this documentation.
