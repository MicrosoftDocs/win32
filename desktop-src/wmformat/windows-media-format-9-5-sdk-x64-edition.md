# Windows Media Format 9.5 SDK x64 Edition

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Format 11 SDK](/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Source Reader](/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader) and [Sink Writer](/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer). **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** instead of **Windows Media Format 11 SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This documentation applies to the new Windows Media Format 9.5 SDK x64 Edition as well as the previous, 32-bit versions of the Windows Media Format SDK.

The following list summarizes the changes to the SDK for the x64-based version:

-   DRM is not supported. DRM-related files (including samples) have been removed from the SDK installation.
-   Windows Media Device Manager is not part of the x64-based SDK installation.
-   The samples and headers that support the Windows Media Audio and Video Codec Interfaces are not part of the x64-based SDK installation.
-   The localized system profiles are not part of the x64-based SDK installation.

Notes throughout the Programming Reference section of this documentation call out features that are not supported in the Windows Media Format 9.5 SDK x64 Edition.
