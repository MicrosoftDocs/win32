# IRMGetLicense interface

\[**IRMGetLicense** is available for use in the operating systems specified in the Requirements section. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use [Microsoft PlayReady](https://www.microsoft.com/PlayReady/). \]

The **IRMGetLicense** interface is implemented in a run-time library that is installed as part of the Windows Media Format SDK. It enables client-side license acquisition. Because this method is used by license issuers through Web-based applications, it is documented in the Windows Media Rights Manager SDK documentation.

## Members

The **IRMGetLicense** interface inherits from the [**IUnknown**](/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown) interface but does not have additional members.

## Requirements



| Requirement | Value |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minimum supported client<br/> | Windows 2000 Professional \[desktop apps only\]<br/> |
| Minimum supported server<br/> | Windows 2000 Server \[desktop apps only\]<br/>       |
