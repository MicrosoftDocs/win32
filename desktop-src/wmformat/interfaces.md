# Interfaces

The following two tables describe the interfaces supported by this SDK and show their relationship to objects and other interfaces.

## Remarks

The interface identifier for each of the interfaces in this SDK is the name of the interface preceded by "IID\_". For example, the identifier for the **IWMReaderAdvanced** interface is IID\_IWMReaderAdvanced. To obtain a pointer to the **IWMReaderAdvanced** interface of a reader object, use the following code, where *pReader* is a pointer to an **IWMReader** interface:


```C++
IWMReaderAdvanced *pReaderAdvanced;
hr = pReader->QueryInterface(IID_IWMReaderAdvanced,
                             (LPVOID*) &amp;pReaderAdvanced);

```
