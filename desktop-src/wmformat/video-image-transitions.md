# Video Image Transitions

The Windows Media Video 9 Image v2 codec animates a series of images, resulting in a video stream. The codec can manipulate two images at once, blending them together and creating a transition from one to the other according to the configuration you supply. This section describes the supported transitions and the parameters they require.

The transitions are listed in the following table by their global identifiers.



| Transition identifier                                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                  |
