# Codec Features

The Windows Media Format SDK is delivered with several audio and video codecs. You can use the codecs provided to compress and decompress content to suit a variety of needs. The codec that is used by the writer to compress data is specified by stream configuration information in the profile. Information from the profile is then stored in the header of the file created by the writer. Then, when the file is opened by the reader or synchronous reader, the profile information in the header identifies the codec needed to decompress the data.

The following features are discussed in this section.

-   [Supported Codecs](supported-codecs.md)
-   [Constant Bit Rate (CBR) Encoding](constant-bit-rate--cbr--encoding.md)
-   [Variable Bit Rate (VBR) Encoding](variable-bit-rate--vbr--encoding.md)
-   [Two-Pass Encoding](two-pass-encoding.md)
-   [High-Resolution Audio Support](high-resolution-audio-support.md)
-   [Low-Delay Audio](low-delay-audio.md)
-   [S/PDIF Audio Output](s-pdif-audio-output.md)
-   [Video Image](video-image.md)
-   [Device Conformance Templates](device-conformance-templates.md)
-   [Video Complexity Settings](video-complexity-settings.md)
-   [Frame Interpolation](frame-interpolation.md)
