# To Read and Write Video Streams with Non-Square Pixels

Computer monitors have square pixels, but other types of video screens, including NTSC televisions, have rectangular or non-square pixels. Also, some input devices, such as Digital Video (DV) cameras, have charged couple devices with non-square pixels. When you are writing files that are either based on non-square pixel source data or else intended for display on devices with non-square pixels, the pixel aspect ratio information must be included in the ASF file. Reader applications must examine that information and use it to adjust the aspect ratio of the video rectangle as necessary.
