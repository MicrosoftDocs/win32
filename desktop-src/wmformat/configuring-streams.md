# Configuring Streams

The only thing that is required in a profile is at least one stream. The other options provide access to more advanced features, but with the minimum of one stream you can make an ASF file. It is essential that you understand how to configure streams before creating complex profiles.

For the purpose of profiles, streams can be divided into two types: those that are compressed with Windows Media codecs and arbitrary streams that are not processed with any codecs. Audio streams and video streams are the types that use the Windows Media codecs. Of course, streams can contain audio or video compressed with a third-party codec, but the process of configuring such a stream is a special case. For more information, see [To Create ASF Files Using Third-Party Codecs](to-create-asf-files-using-third-party-codecs.md).

The following list summarizes the process of configuring a stream.

1.  Obtain a stream configuration object for the stream.
    -   If you are creating a stream using one of the Windows Media codecs, you must obtain the stream configuration object as a codec format using the methods of [**IWMCodecInfo3**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmcodecinfo3).
    -   If the stream is an arbitrary type, get an empty stream configuration object using [**IWMProfile::CreateNewStream**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmprofile-createnewstream).
2.  Configure the stream to meet your needs.
    -   Streams of all types should be assigned a name, connection name, and stream number.
    -   Streams using Windows Media codecs should be altered only in predefined ways from the codec format. For audio streams, only variable bit rate (VBR) settings for two-pass VBR should be changed. Video streams need to be configured with the desired frame properties.
    -   Arbitrary streams have varying configuration requirements by type. All require a bit rate and buffer window.
3.  Add the stream to the profile by calling [**IWMProfile::AddStream**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmprofile-addstream).

All streams are defined using stream configuration objects. The main interface for a stream configuration object is [**IWMStreamConfig**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmstreamconfig), which provides methods for setting the basic settings of a stream, such as the stream number, bit rate, and so on. **IWMStreamConfig** is inherited by the newer interfaces, [**IWMStreamConfig2**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmstreamconfig2) and [**IWMStreamConfig3**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmstreamconfig3). As with all numbered interface revisions, you should always retrieve the most recent version using the **QueryInterface** method.

Most settings in a stream are accessed through [**IWMMediaProps**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmmediaprops). These settings are encapsulated in a [**WM\_MEDIA\_TYPE**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/ns-wmsdkidl-wm_media_type) structure. For audio and video, the **WM\_MEDIA\_TYPE** structure points to another structure with further information specific to the type of media. This secondary structure is typically [**WAVEFORMATEX**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/dd757720(v=vs.85)) for audio and [**WMVIDEOINFOHEADER**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/ns-wmsdkidl-wmvideoinfoheader) for video. In addition, video streams have a tertiary structure, **BITMAPINFOHEADER**, which describes the characteristics of an individual frame of video. **BITMAPINFOHEADER** is a common structure and can be found in the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) section of the Platform SDK.

The following sections describe how to configure streams.
