# To Use Profiles with the Writer

The writer uses profile data to create ASF files. You must specify a profile for use before doing anything else with the writer.

You can set a system profile for use with the writer by passing the profile ID to the [**IWMWriter::SetProfileByID**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmwriter-setprofilebyid) method.

To specify a custom profile for use with the writer, you must obtain an [**IWMProfile**](iwmprofile.md) interface to an object containing the desired profile data. You can use one of the loading methods of the [**IWMProfileManager**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmprofilemanager) interface to accomplish this. After you have a valid **IWMProfile** interface, you can pass a pointer to it to the [**IWMWriter::SetProfile**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmwriter-setprofile) method. For more information about profile settings, see [Working with Profiles](working-with-profiles.md).

If you make changes to the profile object by using the **IWMProfile** interface after setting the profile in the writer, you must call **SetProfile** again, or else the changes will not be reflected in the writer. However, calling **SetProfile** will reset all header attributes, so be sure to set any required header attributes after calling this method.

The following example function sets the profile to "Windows Media Video 8 for Dial-up Modems (56 Kbps)":


```C++
#include <wmsysprf.h>

HRESULT SetProfileExample()
{
  HRESULT hr;
  IWMWriter *pWriter = NULL;
  hr = WMCreateWriter(NULL, &pWriter);
  if (FAILED(hr)) return hr;
  hr = pWriter->SetProfileByID(WMProfile_V80_56Video);
  return hr;
}

```



> [!Note]  
> There are no predefined system profiles that use the Windows Media Audio and Video 9 Series codecs. For more information, see [Reusing Stream Configurations](reusing-stream-configurations.md).
