# Windows Media DRM 10 for Network Devices

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Format 11 SDK](/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Source Reader](/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader) and [Sink Writer](/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer). **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** instead of **Windows Media Format 11 SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Your application can stream protected content to digital media receivers on a network by using Windows Media DRM 10 for Network Devices. This feature is a protocol for securely communicating with network devices.

The Windows Media Format SDK supports Windows Media DRM 10 for Network Devices by maintaining a database of network devices, validating the network proximity of those devices, and converting DRM-protected content to a secured transport format.

> [!Note]  
> DRM is not supported by the x64-based version of this SDK.
