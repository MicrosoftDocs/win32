# Sending ASF Data Over a Network

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Format 11 SDK](/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Source Reader](/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader) and [Sink Writer](/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer). **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** instead of **Windows Media Format 11 SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The Windows Media Format SDK supports two different ways send ASF data over a network:

-   The application can broadcast the ASF data using HTTP protocol.
-   The application can push the ASF data to a publishing point on a Windows Media server. The server then distributes the data.

The following topics describe these features:

-   [Broadcasting ASF Data](broadcasting-asf-data.md)
-   [Sending ASF Data to a Publishing Point](sending-asf-data-to-a-publishing-point.md)
