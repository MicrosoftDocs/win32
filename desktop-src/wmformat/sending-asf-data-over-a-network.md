# Sending ASF Data Over a Network

The Windows Media Format SDK supports two different ways send ASF data over a network:

-   The application can broadcast the ASF data using HTTP protocol.
-   The application can push the ASF data to a publishing point on a Windows Media server. The server then distributes the data.

The following topics describe these features:

-   [Broadcasting ASF Data](broadcasting-asf-data.md)
-   [Sending ASF Data to a Publishing Point](sending-asf-data-to-a-publishing-point.md)
