# Reading ASF Files

The Windows Media Format SDK can be used to deliver media samples from an ASF file. Two objects are used to retrieve samples, the reader object and the synchronous reader object.

The reader object is the original reading object in the Windows Media Format SDK. The reader object uses an asynchronous architecture to push samples to an application. Applications built using the reader object must implement callback functions that respond to the various messages and events that result from this multi-threaded model. For clarity, this section will refer to the reader object as the asynchronous reader.

The synchronous reader object is new for this version of the Windows Media Format SDK. The synchronous reader does not use multiple threads in processing samples from ASF files. An application built using the synchronous reader retrieves samples on demand, rather than waiting for the reader to send them.

When creating an application to read ASF files, you must choose which reader object to use. In general, applications designed to deliver Windows Media-based content should be created using the asynchronous reader, while applications designed to edit ASF files should be created with the synchronous reader.

The following table lists the major features of both reader objects. Use this table to help determine which object to use for your application.



| Feature                                                                    | Async reader | Sync reader |
