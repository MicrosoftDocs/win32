# Live DRM

Starting with Windows Media 9 Series, the Windows Media Format SDK can be used to write DRM-protected files. This enables scenarios such as Live DRM, in which DRM protection is applied to a file or stream as it is being encoded, rather than as a post-processing step after encoding has been completed. Live DRM enables content owners to protect live broadcasts, such as pay-per-view concerts or sporting events. Live DRM also represents a simplified or streamlined way to create protected files. You can use Live DRM to apply any version of DRM protection. A protected file created using Live DRM is exactly the same as a file protected as a post-processing step.

**Note** DRM is not supported by the x64-based version of this SDK.
