# Explicit Authorization and Inclusion Lists

Licenses can contain an inclusion list to explicitly authorize the exporting of content protected by Windows Media DRM to other content protection schemes (CPS). As per the terms of the license agreement you enter into with Microsoft to enable DRM Export you can export only to a valid CPS that is identified in the inclusion list of a license.

An inclusion list is a bounded array of globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) that each represents a specific authorized CPS to which the content can be exported. The GUIDs listed in an inclusion list are independent of the output protection levels (OPL) and content protection levels (CPL). Enforcing these restrictions is the responsibility of your application.

> [!Note]  
> When performing Windows Media DRM Export on compressed content, you access the inclusion list through the [**IWMDRMLicense::GetInclusionList**](iwmdrmlicense-getinclusionlist.md) method. When performing Windows Media DRM Export on uncompressed content, use the [**IWMDRMReader3::GetInclusionList**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmdrmreader3-getinclusionlist) method.

 

To register a new content protection system as a Windows Media DRM Permitted Export in the Windows Media DRM export compliance rules, please contact wmla@microsoft.com.
