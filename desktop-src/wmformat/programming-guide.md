# Windows Media Format SDK Programming Guide

The Programming Guide is intended to help you learn how to use the Microsoft Windows Media Format Software Development Kit (SDK) to build applications that work with files using the Advanced Systems Format (ASF).

You can use the Windows Media Format SDK to create applications that write digital media streams to and read streams from ASF files. This SDK also supports the editing of metadata in ASF files. In addition, this SDK can be used to read and manipulate metadata in MP3 files.

The following sections explain in detail the steps required to write, read, and edit ASF files by using this SDK.



| Section                                                                            | Description                                                                                                       |
