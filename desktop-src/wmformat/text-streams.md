# Text Streams

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Format 11 SDK](/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Source Reader](/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader) and [Sink Writer](/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer). **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Source Reader** and **Sink Writer** instead of **Windows Media Format 11 SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Text streams contain plain text stored in samples. Your application can use text from a text stream in any way you choose. For example, you might want to create a language tutor application that introduces words in a foreign language. You could include each word as a text stream sample at a presentation time that corresponds with the spoken word in an audio stream. Then your application could render the text when the sample is delivered.
