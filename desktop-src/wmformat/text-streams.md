# Text Streams

Text streams contain plain text stored in samples. Your application can use text from a text stream in any way you choose. For example, you might want to create a language tutor application that introduces words in a foreign language. You could include each word as a text stream sample at a presentation time that corresponds with the spoken word in an audio stream. Then your application could render the text when the sample is delivered.
