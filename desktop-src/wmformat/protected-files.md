# Protected Files

When a file is protected by using Windows Media DRM, the data section of the file is encrypted. The process of protecting a file is also called packaging the file. The Windows Media DRM Client Extended APIs do not enable you to package files. You can package files using the objects of the Windows Media Rights Manager SDK or the Windows Media Format SDK.

A user cannot access the data in a protected file without first obtaining a license for that file.
