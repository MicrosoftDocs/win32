# Handling Individualization Events

When a DRM-enabled application attempts to open a protected file, the DRM component examines the [**DRM\_DRMHeader\_IndividualizedVersion**](drm-drmheader-individualizedversion.md) attribute in the file, which specifies the minimum version level required to access the content. All levels of the DRM component work with all 7.0 and later versions of Windows Media Player and the Windows Media Format SDK. If the DRM component's individualized version level is lower than the required version, the DRM component will send a **WMT\_NEEDS\_INDIVIDUALIZATION** event to the application's [**IWMStatusCallback::OnStatus**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmstatuscallback-onstatus) method. The application must then display a message or dialog box prompting users to either start or cancel the security upgrade. This prompt is necessary because, for privacy reasons, users must give their permission before a security upgrade is installed on their computer.

> [!Note]  
> The header of the content specifies only the first two digits for DRM\_DRMVersion\_IndividualizedVersion. In other words, to require a level 2.2.0.1 DRM component, the header would contain "2.2".

 

To start the security upgrade and/or trigger individualization, call the [**IWMDRMReader::Individualize**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmdrmreader-individualize) method with the *dwFlags* parameter set to 1.

You must handle the **WMT\_INDIVIDUALIZE** event in your application. This event will be fired multiple times by the DRM component with the status of the individualization process indicated in the *pValue* parameter, which is cast to a pointer to a [**WM\_INDIVIDUALIZE\_STATUS**](wm-individualize-status.md) structure.

After the DRM component is successfully individualized, the application will receive a **WMT\_NO\_RIGHTS\_EX** event, indicating that the application can now proceed to acquire a license for the content.

> [!Note]  
> DRM is not supported by the x64-based version of this SDK.
