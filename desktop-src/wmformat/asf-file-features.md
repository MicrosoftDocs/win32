# ASF File Features

The primary purpose of the Windows Media Format SDK is to provide support for encapsulating digital media data in Advanced Systems Format (ASF) files and delivering the media to a client application. Delivery scenarios can vary widely from application to application, but all use the ASF file structure between authoring and delivery. ASF files conform to a well defined but very flexible structure. For more information about the ASF file structure, see [Overview of the ASF Format](overview-of-the-asf-format.md).

Detailed information about the data in an ASF file is provided in the ASF specification, which you can download from the [Microsoft Web site](https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/9/0/790fecaa-f64a-4a5e-a430-0bccdab3f1b4/ASF_Specification.doc).

The Windows Media Format SDK provides support for the features of the ASF specification mostly through the profile that is used to create a file. For more information about profiles, see [Profiles](profiles.md).
