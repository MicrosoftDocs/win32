# Video Complexity Settings

Some video codecs support multiple *complexity levels*. The complexity level used to encode a stream does not directly affect the bit rate of that stream, but can affect the quality. Where bit rate is a measure of the size of the compressed samples in the ASF file, complexity level is a measure of the processing power needed to reconstruct the compressed data. Complexity level is therefore dictated more by the processing power of the playing platform than by the available bandwidth.

For information about working with complexity levels, see [Configuring Video Streams](configuring-video-streams.md).
