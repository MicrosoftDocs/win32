# File Writing Features

One of the primary features of the Windows Media Format SDK is the ability to write files in the Advanced Systems Format (ASF). The writer object is used to write ASF files. For more information see, [Writer Object](writer-object.md).

In the most basic file writing scenario, you assign a profile to use and a name of the file to create. You pass samples to the writer one at a time. When you have finished passing samples to the writer, it finishes its operations and completes the ASF file. For more information about basic file writing, see [Writing ASF Files](writing-asf-files.md).

The writer supports several advanced features, which are discussed in the following sections.

-   [Video Resizing](video-resizing.md)
-   [Color Space Conversion](color-space-conversion.md)
-   [Audio Resampling](audio-resampling.md)
-   [Sinks](sinks.md)
-   [Watermarking Support](watermarking-support.md)
-   [Input Formats, Input Settings, and Data Unit Extensions](input-formats-input-settings-and-data-unit-extensions.md)
-   [Input Format Enumeration](input-format-enumeration.md)
