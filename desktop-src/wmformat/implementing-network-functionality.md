# Implementing Network Functionality

This section describes how to use the networking features available through the Windows Media Format SDK. An application can use these features to read ASF streams from a network, broadcast ASF streams to a network, or push ASF streams to a publishing point on a server running Windows Media Services.

The following sections describe the networking features of this SDK.

| [Overview of Networking Interfaces](overview-of-networking-interfaces.md) | Names and describes each interface that supports networking methods.                                                 |
| [Reading ASF Data Over a Network](reading-asf-data-over-a-network.md)     | Describes how to play files from a network source and how to configure the network settings on the reader object.    |
| [Sending ASF Data Over a Network](sending-asf-data-over-a-network.md)     | Describes how to broadcast ASF data over a network or send ASF data to a publishing point on a Windows Media server. |
| [Default Networking Settings](default-networking-settings.md)             | Provides a quick reference for the default settings used by the SDK.                                                 |
