# Backing Up and Restoring Licenses

The backup and restore processes are asynchronous. They are triggered when the user selects a menu command or option in the application to back up or restore licenses. You should allow the user to specify the locations where licenses must be backed up to and restored from.

To back up licenses:

1.  Use the [**WMCreateBackupRestorer**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-wmcreatebackuprestorer) function to create the backup restorer object.
2.  Call the [**IWMBackupRestoreProps::SetProp**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmbackuprestoreprops-setprop) method to set the backup path (the location where you will write the files, such as A:\\ or D:\\Licenses).
3.  Call the [**IWMLicenseBackup::BackupLicenses**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmlicensebackup-backuplicenses) method to back up the licenses to the specified path.

The following events are sent to the [**IWMStatusCallback::OnStatus**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmstatuscallback-onstatus) method:

-   **WMT\_BACKUPRESTORE\_BEGIN** indicates the backup process has started.
-   **WMT\_BACKUPRESTORE\_END** indicates the backup process has been completed.
-   **WMT\_RESTRICTED\_LICENSE** indicates that one or more licenses cannot be backed up because the right has been disallowed by the content owner.

The key ID is also included in this message. If you have implemented a database for protected files that includes the key ID and metadata, you can display a message to the user with the specific title (such as a song title) for which the license cannot be backed up. Otherwise, the message must be generic and inform the user that some licenses cannot be backed up.

To restore licenses:

1.  Use the **WMCreateBackupRestorer** function to create the backup restorer object.
2.  Call the **IWMBackupRestoreProps::SetProp** method to set the restore path to the location where licenses are backed up.
3.  Call the [**IWMLicenseRestore::RestoreLicenses**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmlicenserestore-restorelicenses) method to restore licenses from that location.

The following events are sent to the [**IWMStatusCallback::OnStatus**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmstatuscallback-onstatus) method:

-   **WMT\_BACKUPRESTORE\_CONNECTING** indicates that the application is connecting to the License Management Service.
-   **WMT\_BACKUPRESTORE\_DISCONNECTING** indicates that the application is disconnecting from the License Management Service.
-   **WMT\_BACKUPRESTORE\_BEGIN** indicates the restore process has started.
-   **WMT\_BACKUPRESTORE\_END** indicates the restore process has been completed.
