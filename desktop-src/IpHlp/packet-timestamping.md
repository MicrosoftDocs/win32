# Packet timestamping

## Introduction

Many network interface cards (NICs, or network adapters) can generate a timestamp in their hardware whenever a packet is received or transmitted. The timestamp is generated using the NIC's own hardware clock. This feature is used in particular by the Precision Time Protocol (PTP), which is a time synchronization protocol. PTP makes provision to use such hardware timestamps within the protocol itself.

The timestamps can, for example, be used to compute the time spent by a packet within the network stack of the machine before being sent to or received from the wire. Those calculations can then be used by PTP to improve the accuracy of time synchronization. The packet timestamping support of network adapters is geared sometimes specifically for the PTP protocol. In other cases, a more general support is provided.

Timestamping APIs give Windows the ability to support the hardware timestamping capability of network adapters for the PTP version 2 protocol. Overall, the features include providing the ability to drivers of network adapters to support timestamps, and for user-mode applications to consume timestamps associated with packets through [Windows Sockets](../winsock/windows-sockets-start-page-2.md) (see [Winsock timestamping](../winsock/winsock-timestamping.md)). In addition, the ability to generate software timestamps is also available, which allows a network driver to generate timestamps in software. Such software timestamps are generated by NIC drivers using the kernel-mode equivalent of [**QueryPerformanceCounter**](/windows/win32/api/profileapi/nf-profileapi-queryperformancecounter) (QPC). However, having both hardware *and* software timestamps enabled together isn't supported.

In particular, the Internet Protocol Helper (IP Helper) packet timestamping APIs described in this topic provide the ability for user-mode applications to determine the timestamping capability of a network adapter, and to query timestamps from the network adapter in the form of cross timestamps (described below).

## Supporting Precision Time Protocol version 2

As mentioned, the main goal of timestamping support in Windows is to support the Precision Time Protocol version 2 (PTPv2) protocol. Within PTPv2, not all messages need a timestamp. In particular, PTP event messages do use timestamps. Currently, support is scoped to PTPv2 over User Datagram Protocol (UDP). PTP over raw ethernet isn't supported.

Timestamping is supported for PTPv2 operating in *2 step* mode. *2 step* refers to the mode in which the actual timestamps in the PTP packets aren't generated on the fly in the hardware, but are instead retrieved from the hardware and conveyed as separate messages (for example, using a follow-up message).

In summary, you can use the Internet Protocol Helper (IP Helper) packet timestamping APIs, together with Winsock's timestamping support, in a PTPv2 application to improve its time synchronization accuracy.

## Retrieving the timestamping capabilities of a network adapter

An application such as a PTP time synchronization service needs to determine the timestamping capability of a network adapter. Using the retrieved capabilities, the application can then decide whether or not it wants to use timestamps.

Even if a network adapter *does* support timestamps, it's required to keep the ability turned off by default. An adapter turns on timestamping when instructed to do so. Windows provides APIs for an application to retrieve the hardware's capability, as well as which capabilities are turned on.

To retrieve the supported timestamp capabilities of a network adapter, you call the [**GetInterfaceSupportedTimestampCapabilities**](/windows/win32/api/iphlpapi/nf-iphlpapi-getinterfacesupportedtimestampcapabilities) function, providing the locally unique identifier (LUID) of the network adapter, and in return retrieving the supported timestamping capabilities in the form of an [**INTERFACE_TIMESTAMP_CAPABILITIES**](/windows/win32/api/iphlpapi/ns-iphlpapi-interface_timestamp_capabilities) object.

The code returned from **GetInterfaceSupportedTimestampCapabilities** indicates whether or not the call succeeded, and whether or not a populated **INTERFACE_TIMESTAMP_CAPABILITIES** value was retrieved.

To retrieve the currently enabled timestamp capabilities of a network adapter, you call the [**GetInterfaceActiveTimestampCapabilities**](/windows/win32/api/iphlpapi/nf-iphlpapi-getinterfaceactivetimestampcapabilities) function, providing the locally unique identifier (LUID) of the network adapter, and in return retrieving the enabled timestamping capabilities in the form of an [**INTERFACE_TIMESTAMP_CAPABILITIES**](/windows/win32/api/iphlpapi/ns-iphlpapi-interface_timestamp_capabilities) object.

Again, the code returned from **GetInterfaceActiveTimestampCapabilities** indicates success or failure, and whether or not a valid **INTERFACE_TIMESTAMP_CAPABILITIES** value was retrieved.

Network adapters can support a variety of timestamping capabilities. For example, some adapters can timestamp every packet during send and receive, while others support only PTPv2 packets. The [**INTERFACE_TIMESTAMP_CAPABILITIES**](/windows/win32/api/iphlpapi/ns-iphlpapi-interface_timestamp_capabilities) structure describes the exact capabilities that a network adapter supports.

## Retrieving cross timestamps from a network adapter

When using hardware timestamps, a PTP application needs to establish a relation (for example, by using appropriate mathematical techniques) between the hardware clock of the network adapter and a system clock. This is necessary so that a value representing a time in one clock's unit can be converted into another clock's unit. Cross timestamps are provided for this purpose, and your application can sample cross timestamps periodically in order to establish such a relation.

To do that, call the [**CaptureInterfaceHardwareCrossTimestamp**](/windows/win32/api/iphlpapi/nf-iphlpapi-captureinterfacehardwarecrosstimestamp) function, providing the locally unique identifier (LUID) of the network adapter, and in return retrieving the timestamp from the network adapter in the form of an [**INTERFACE_HARDWARE_CROSSTIMESTAMP**](/windows/win32/api/iphlpapi/ns-iphlpapi-interface_hardware_crosstimestamp) object.

## Timestamp capability change notifications

To be notified should the timestamp capabilities for a network adapter change, call the [**RegisterInterfaceTimestampConfigChange**](/windows/win32/api/iphlpapi/nf-iphlpapi-registerinterfacetimestampconfigchange) function, providing a pointer to the callback function that you've implemented, together with an optional caller-allocated context.

**RegisterInterfaceTimestampConfigChange** returns a handle that you can subsequently pass to [**UnregisterInterfaceTimestampConfigChange**](/windows/win32/api/iphlpapi/nf-iphlpapi-unregisterinterfacetimestampconfigchange) in order to unregister your callback function.

// Globals and function declarations used by the application.
// The sample functions and skeletons demonstrate:
// - Checking timestamp configuration for an interface to determine if timestamping can be used
// - If timestamping is enabled, starts tracking changes in timestamp configuration
// - Performing correlation between hardware and system timestamps using cross timestamps
//   on a separate thread depending on the timestamp type configured
// - Receiving a packet and computing the latency between when the timestamp
//   was generated on packet reception, and when the packet was received by
//   the application through the socket
// The sample tries to demonstrate how an application could use timestamps. It is not thread safe 
// and does not do exhaustive error checking.
// Lot of the functions are provided as skeletons, or only declared and invoked
// but are not defined. It is up to
// the application to implement these suitably.
