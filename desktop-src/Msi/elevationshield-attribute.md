# ElevationShield Attribute

This attribute adds the [*User Account Control*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*User Account Control*) (UAC) elevation icon (shield icon) to the [PushButton control](pushbutton-control.md).

If this bit is set, and the installation is not yet running with [*elevated*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*elevated*) privileges, the pushbutton control is created using the [*User Account Control*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*User Account Control*) (UAC) elevation icon (shield icon).

If this bit is set, and the installation is already running with [*elevated*](https://www.bing.com/search?q=*elevated*) privileges, the pushbutton control is created using the other icon attributes.

If this bit is not set, the pushbutton control is created using the other icon attributes.
