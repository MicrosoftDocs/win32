# Installer Units

A Windows Installer user interface unit is approximately equal to one-twelfth (1/12) the height of the 10-point MS Sans Serif font size. The relative size of dialogs, controls and fonts can change depending upon the font size used in the user interface. To ensure the correct display of the user interface, setup developers should always test their application using the actual font sizes.
