# Properties Table (Patchwiz.dll)

The Properties Table contains global settings for the patch package. The Properties Table is required in the patch creation database (.pcp file), and is used by the [UiCreatePatchPackageEx](uicreatepatchpackageex--patchwiz-dll-.md) function.

The Properties Table has the following columns.



| Column | Type | Key | Nullable |
|--------|------|-----|----------|
| Name   | text | Y   | N        |
| Value  | text |     | Y        |

| AllowLaxValidationFlags              | If this property is set to 1, an entry is written in the log and no error is returned if the ProductValidateFlags field in the [TargetImages table](targetimages-table-patchwiz-dll-.md) cannot be validated. This property should only be set when the patch author has changed the value in the ProductValidateFlags field. The default value for this property is 0.

| DontRemoveTempFolderWhenFinished     | Set to '1' to mean True if the temporary folder containing the transforms, the byte-level patches, and the entire new files are not being removed after creating the patch package. This is essentially the contents of the .msp file before being embedded into the patch package. This may be useful for debugging patches. Set to '0' or blank to mean False if the temporary folder is to be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| IncludeWholeFilesOnly                | Set to '1' to mean True if files being changed are to be included in their entirety when creating the patch package instead of creating a binary file patch. The patch files will be bigger in size but the API runs faster. Set to '0' or blank to mean False if creating a binary file patch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ListOfPatchGUIDsToReplace            | A list of PatchGUID identifiers with no delimiter. If any of these patches are found to be installed on the user's computer and registered with Windows Installer, they are unregistered from the appropriate product and their patch transforms are removed from the list of transforms associated with the product. Note that the removal of a patch does not affect any of the files, only the registration of the patch.

| ListOfTargetProductCodes             | A list of [Product Codes](product-codes.md) for products that may receive this patch. This is a semicolon delimited list of [ProductCode](productcode.md) Property values. If the list begins with an asterisk, the list of product codes is generated from the .msi files of the targets listed in the [TargetImages Table](targetimages-table-patchwiz-dll-.md). If any product codes follow a leading asterisk, they are appended to the list that replaces the asterisk.

| MinimumRequiredMsiVersion            | Set this property to force Patchwiz.dll to generate a patch that requires a particular version of Windows Installer. This property value helps determine what value to use for the [**Word Count Summary**](word-count-summary.md) Property of the patch package. The value for this property is of the same form as the [**Page Count Summary**](page-count-summary.md) Property of the installation package. If a .pcp file has a MinimumRequiredMsiVersion equal to 200, Patchwiz.dll sets the [**Word Count Summary**](word-count-summary.md) property of the patch package to 3. This prevents the patch from being applied by Windows Installer version earlier than version 2.0.<br/> If a .pcp file has a MinimumRequiredMsiVersion equal to 300, Patchwiz.dll sets the [**Word Count Summary**](word-count-summary.md) Property of the patch package to 4. This prevents the patch from being applied by Windows Installer versions earlier than version 3.0.<br/> If a .pcp file has a MinimumRequiredMsiVersion equal to 310, Patchwiz.dll sets the [**Word Count Summary**](word-count-summary.md) Property of the patch package to 5. This prevents the patch from being applied by Windows Installer earlier than version 3.1.<br/> If a .pcp file has a MinimumRequiredMsiVersion equal to 400, Patchwiz.dll sets the [**Word Count Summary**](word-count-summary.md) property of the patch package to 6. This prevents the patch from being applied by Windows Installer earlier than version 4.0.<br/> |
| PATCH\_CACHE\_ENABLED                | Set this property to 1 to cache the patch creation information in the folder specified by the PATCH\_CACHE\_DIR property. Patch caching increases the speed of patch creation when recreating a new patch after updating the update image. This property requires Patchwiz.dll in Windows InstallerÂ  2.0 or later.
