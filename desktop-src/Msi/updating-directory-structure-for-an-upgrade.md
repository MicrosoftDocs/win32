# Updating Directory Structure for an Upgrade

Use the database editor Orca that is provided with the SDK, or another editor, to open the [Directory table](directory-table.md) in MNP2001.msi. The directory structure of the sample upgrade is the same as the directory structure of the original product and no changes are required to the original Directory table described in [Specifying Directory Structure](specifying-directory-structure.md).
