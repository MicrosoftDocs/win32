# RegPath

The RegPath data type is a text string containing a Registry path. Registry paths can include properties, as with the [Formatted](formatted.md) data type. A RegPath may not begin or end with a backslash (\\). The \[\#file key\] and \[$component key\] can be embedded in the path or preceded by other characters.
