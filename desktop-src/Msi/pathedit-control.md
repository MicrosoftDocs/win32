# PathEdit Control

The PathEdit control displays an edit field that enables a user to select the end section of a path. This control supports entering the selected folder name or the entire path in the edit field. A user can also enter a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path to a drive that has no drive letter. If the user enters an end segment for the path that is invalid for the present volume, PathEdit control cannot transfer the focus to the next control.

The PathEdit control, [DirectoryCombo](directorycombo-control.md), and [DirectoryList](directorylist-control.md) controls are associated with the same string valued property. That property is the path selected by the user. Enter the property's name into the Property column of the [Control table](control-table.md). This property must have an initial value containing at least a one volume and one sublevel. Specify the initial value for the property in the Value column of the [Property table](property-table.md).

This control is intended to be used on a [Browse Dialog](browse-dialog.md) together with the PathEdit and [DirectoryList](directorylist-control.md) controls.

## Control Attributes

You can use the following attributes with this control. To change the value of an attribute using an event, subscribe the control to a ControlEvent in the [EventMapping table](eventmapping-table.md) and list the attribute's identifier in the Attribute column. Enter the identifier of the ControlEvent in the Event column.

## Remarks

The PathEdit control is derived from the [Edit](edit-control.md) control.

For compatibility with screen readers, when authoring a dialog box with a PathEdit control as the first active control, you must make the text field belonging to the edit field the first active control in the [Dialog table](dialog-table.md). Since the static text cannot take focus, when the dialog box is created, the edit field will have the focus initially as intended; this ensures that screen readers show the correct information.
