# Using Isolated Components

By using [isolated components](isolated-components.md), authors of installation packages can specify that the installer copy the shared files of an application directly into the application's folder rather than to a shared location. This private set of files are then used exclusively by the application.

For more information, see [Installing a COM component to a private location](installing-a-com-component-to-a-private-location.md), [Installing a non-COM component to a private location](installing-a-non-com-component-to-a-private-location.md), [Make a COM component in an existing package private](make-a-com-component-in-an-existing-package-private.md) , or [Make a non-COM component in an existing package private](make-a-non-com-component-in-an-existing-package-private.md).
