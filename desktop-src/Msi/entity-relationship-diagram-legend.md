# Entity Relationship Diagram Legend

A black circle leading to an open diamond indicates a one-to-many relationship between the primary key of the first table and the foreign key of the second table. For an example of this look at the figure for the [Registry Tables Group](registry-tables-group.md). Extension is a primary key of the Extension table and a foreign key of the Verb table. One Extension can therefore can be registered to have several Verbs, but a particular Verb can only be associated to one Extension.
