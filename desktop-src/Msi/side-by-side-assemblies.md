# Side-by-Side Assemblies

Side-by-Side assembly sharing is an infrastructure that is used to do the following:

-   Safely share assemblies among multiple applications
-   Offset some negative effects of sharing, for example, DLL conflicts.

Instead of having a single version of an assembly that assumes backward compatibility with all applications, side-by-side assembly sharing enables multiple versions of a COM or Win32 assembly to run simultaneously on a system. For more information, see [Isolated Applications and Side-by-side Assemblies](../sbscs/isolated-applications-and-side-by-side-assemblies-portal.md).

Side-by-Side Assemblies can be installed as [Shared Assemblies](shared-assemblies.md) or as [Private Assemblies](private-assemblies.md).

Side-by-Side Assemblies are not available on systems earlier than Windows XP.
