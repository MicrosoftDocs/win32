# Setting Public Property Values on the Command Line

To set a public property to a literal string value, include the string between quotation marks.

PROPERTY = "string"

The quotation marks are only required if the string contains spaces. To clear a public property at a command line (setting it to Null), set the property's value to an empty string. In this case, quotation marks are required.

PROPERTY="".
