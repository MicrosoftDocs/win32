# DiskCost Dialog

A DiskCost dialog box commonly appears when the [**OutOfDiskSpace**](outofdiskspace.md) property is set. This indicates that there is not enough disk space for the selected installation.

This dialog box may also be activated from the [Selection Dialog](selection-dialog.md) to give the user an overview of the disk space needed for the installation.

A DiskCost dialog box box is a modal dialog box box. It commonly contains a [PushButton](pushbutton-control.md) that returns the user to the previous dialog box box and a [VolumeCostList control](volumecostlist-control.md).
