# Uninstalling Custom Actions

Developers of installation packages that make use of custom actions must determine in each case how to condition the custom action to work correctly when the package is uninstalled. It is up to the package author to decide whether to condition the custom action to run on uninstall, not to run on uninstall, or to run an alternate custom action on uninstall.
