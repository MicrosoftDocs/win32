# ComboBox Control

The ComboBox control displays a drop-down list of predefined values and an edit field into which the user can enter a value. To associate this control with a string or integer property, enter the property's name in the Property column of the [Control table](control-table.md).

## Control Attributes

You can use the following attributes with this control. To change the value of an attribute using an event, subscribe the control to a ControlEvent in the [EventMapping table](eventmapping-table.md) and list the attribute's identifier in the Attribute column. Enter the identifier of the ControlEvent in the Event column.



| Attribute identifier                                               | Hexadecimal bit                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Remarks

This control can be created from the COMBOBOX class by using the [**CreateWindowEx**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-createwindowexa) function. It has the **CBS\_AUTOHSCROLL**, **WS\_TABSTOP**, **WS\_GROUP**, and **WS\_CHILD** styles. If the ComboList bit is on, it also has the **CBS\_DROPDOWNLIST** style, otherwise it has the **CBS\_DROPDOWN** style.

The length of the text that can be entered can be limited by putting a number from 0 to 2147483646 in curly braces at the beginning of the Text field in the [Control table](control-table.md). For example if the text field starts with {80}, the length of the string is limited at 80 characters. If no such limit is supplied in the table, or if 0 is specified, the length is set to the maximum possible (2147483646 characters). A negative or non-numeric value will generate an error.

For compatibility with screen readers, when authoring a dialog box with a ComboBox control as the first active control, you must make the text field belonging to the edit field the first active control in the [Dialog table](dialog-table.md). Since the static text cannot take focus, when the dialog box is created, the edit field will have the focus initially as intended. Doing this ensures that screen readers show the correct information.
