# CustomSource

The CustomSource data type is either a valid [Identifier](identifier.md) or an external key depending on the Type column of the [CustomAction table](customaction-table.md). It can be an external key into the [Binary table](binary-table.md), [File table](file-table.md), [Directory table](directory-table.md), and [Property table](property-table.md). Note that external keys into the Property Table are not validated because properties can be added at run-time.
