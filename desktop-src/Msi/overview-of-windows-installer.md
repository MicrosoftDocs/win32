# Overview of Windows Installer

The Windows Installer reduces the total cost of ownership (TCO) for your customers by enabling them to efficiently install and configure your products and applications.

-   [Installation Package](installation-package.md)
-   [Components and Features](components-and-features.md)
-   [Installation Mechanism](installation-mechanism.md)
-   [Component Management](component-management.md)
-   [Advertisement](advertisement.md)
-   [Installation-On-Demand](installation-on-demand.md)
-   [Resiliency](resiliency.md)
