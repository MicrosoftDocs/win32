# View.Modify method

The **Modify** method of the [**View**](view-object.md) object modifies a database row with a modified [**Record**](record-object.md) object obtained by the [**Fetch**](view-fetch.md) method.

## Syntax


```JScript
View.Modify(
  action,
  record
)
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*action* 
</dt> <dd>

Required action to be performed on the database row. This action is one of those shown in the following table.

Â 

</dd> <dt>

*record* 
</dt> <dd>

Required. [**Record**](record-object.md) object obtained by the [**Fetch**](view-fetch.md) method with modified field data.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

This method does not return a value.

## Remarks

This method must be called after the [**Execute**](view-execute.md) method.

To execute any SQL statement, a view must be created. However, a view that does not create a result set, such as CREATE TABLE or INSERT INTO, cannot be used with the **Modify** method to update tables though the view.

The msiViewModifyValidate, msiViewModifyValidateNew, msiViewModifyValidateField, and msiViewModifyValidateDelete values of the **Modify** method do not perform actual updates; they ensure that the data in the record is valid. Use of these actions requires that the database contain a [\_Validation table](-validation-table.md) .

You cannot fetch a record containing binary data from one database and then use that record to insert the data into a completely different database. To move binary data from one database to another, you should export the data to a file and then import it into the new database using the [**SetStream**](record-setstream.md) method of the [**Record**](record-object.md) object. This ensures that each database has its own copy of the binary data.

> [!Note]  
> Custom actions can only add, modify, or remove temporary rows, columns, or tables from a database. Custom actions cannot modify persistent data in a database, such as data that is a part of the database stored on disk. For more information, see [Accessing the Current Installer Session from Inside a Custom Action](accessing-the-current-installer-session-from-inside-a-custom-action.md).

If the method fails, you can obtain extended error information by using the [**LastErrorRecord**](installer-lasterrorrecord.md) method.
