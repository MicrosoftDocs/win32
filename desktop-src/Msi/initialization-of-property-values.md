# Initialization of Property Values

It is recommended that all properties to be used by the installation be entered into the [Property table](property-table.md) with an initial value. The installer sets the properties to these values at the launch of the installation. Properties for which a blank is an acceptable value and properties built into the installer do not need to be initialized.
