# File Searching

During installation, there is often the need to search for a specific file. The installer has four standard search actions to serve this purpose. The [AppSearch action](appsearch-action.md) uses the [AppSearch table](appsearch-table.md) to determine if a file exists on a user's system. During an upgrade installation, the [CCPSearch action](ccpsearch-action.md) and the [RMCCPSearch action](rmccpsearch-action.md) can use their corresponding tables to check the user's system for a previous version of a product.
