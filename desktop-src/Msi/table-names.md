# Table Names

Table names are limited to 31 characters. If a table name contains a period (a practice that is permitted but not recommended), the name must be enclosed within grave accent marks \` (ASCII value 96), for example, \`filename.ext\`. This escape syntax prevents clashes between the table name and reserved words, such as SQL keywords. For more information, see [SQL Syntax](sql-syntax.md).
