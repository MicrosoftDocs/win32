# Wilogutl.exe

Wilogutl.exe assists the analysis of log files from a Windows Installer installation, and it displays suggested solutions to errors that are found in a log file.

Non-critical errors are not displayed. Wilogutl.exe can be run in quiet mode or with a user interface (UI). The tool generates reports as text files in both the UI and quiet modes. It works best with verbose Windows Installer log files, but also works with non-verbose logs. For more information, see [Logging](logging.md).

This tool is only available in the [Windows SDK Components for Windows Installer Developers](platform-sdk-components-for-windows-installer-developers.md).

## Syntax

**wilogutl.exe** *\[&lt;options&gt;\]\[\<source file\>\]\[&lt;options&gt;\]\[\<report file directory\>\]*

You can use the following command lines to run in quiet mode.

**wilogutl /q /l** *c:\\mymsilog.log* **/o** *c\\outputdir\\*

**wilogutl /q /l** *c:\\mymsilog.log*

## Command-Line Options

Wilogutl.exe uses the following case insensitive command-line options. A dash delimiter can be used in place of a slash.



| Option | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| none   | Runs in UI mode—without command-line options.                                                                                                                                                   |
| /q     | Specifies the quiet mode. Wilogutl.exe generates report files and does not display a user interface.                                                                                            |
| /l     | Specifies the name of the log file to be analyzed. This option is required when using the quiet mode.                                                                                           |
| /o     | Specifies the output directory for report files. This output path is used only when running in quiet mode. If the option is not present, the reports are put in the C:\\WiLogResults directory. |
