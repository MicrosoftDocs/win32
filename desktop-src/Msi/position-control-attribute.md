# Position Control Attribute

This attribute determines the position of the control on the dialog box. The four fields of the attribute are: left, top, width, and height. Enter the control's width, height, and coordinates of the control's left corner into the Width, Height, X, and Y columns of the [Control table](control-table.md). Use [installer units](installer-units.md) for units of length and distance.

## Valid Controls

All active controls.

## Associated Bit Flags

This attribute does not use bit flags.

## Remarks

See [Control Attributes](control-attributes.md) and the control you need to create under [Controls](controls.md).

An installer unit is equal to one-twelfth the height of the 10-point MS Sans Serif font size.
