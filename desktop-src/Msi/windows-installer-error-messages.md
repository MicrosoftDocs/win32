# Windows Installer Error Messages (for Developers)

This article is intended for software developers who are using Windows Installer to build installer packages for their applications. 

> [!NOTE]  
> If you need support for a Microsoft product, please go to our technical support site at [support.microsoft.com](https://support.microsoft.com).

The error codes detailed in this topic are returned by the Windows Installer, and have error codes of 1000 or greater. The error codes numbered 1000 to 1999 are ship errors and must be authored into the [Error table](error-table.md). The error codes numbered greater than 2000 are internal errors and do not have authored strings, but these can occur if the installation package has been incorrectly authored. For error codes specific to the Windows Installer functions **MsiExec.exe** and **InstMsi.exe**, see [MsiExec.exe and InstMsi.exe Error Messages](error-codes.md). For a list of reserved error codes, see [Error table](error-table.md). You can search the Internet or the [Microsoft support site](https://support.microsoft.com/) for solutions to many of the messages in the following table.

Developers of installation packages can also test the internal consistency of their packages by using Internal Consistency Evaluators. For more information, see [Internal Consistency Evaluators - ICEs](internal-consistency-evaluators-ices.md).

The Hyperlink control requires Windows Installer 5.0. In this case, author two versions of the dialog, one with the control and one without. Use conditional statements to display the dialog box without the control if the [**VersionMsi**](versionmsi.md) property is less than “5.00”. Display the dialog with the Hyperlink control if **VersionMsi** is greater than or equal to “5.00”.<br/> |
