-   [Delta Compression Application Programming Interface](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms811406.aspx)

## Online Windows Installer SDK

You can read about Windows Installer online:

-   [Windows Installer SDK](./windows-installer-portal.md)
    > [!Note]  
    > You need to download and install the [Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/) to obtain the development tools described in the [Windows Installer Development Tools](windows-installer-development-tools.md) section of the documentation.

     

## Orca Documentation

[Orca](orca-exe.md) is a GUI .msi file editor that is provided with the Windows Installer SDK. It provides full access to the Windows Installer database tables.

A set of Help files are provided with Orca. To obtain the orca.exe and Orca documentation you must download and install the Windows Installer SDK, which is provided as an Orca.msi file. After you install the [Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/), double click the Orca.msi file to install Orca.

> [!Note]  
> It is not possible to download Orca separately.

 

Although Orca provides access to all features of the Windows Installer, it is not intended to replace a fully featured package-authoring environment. In many cases, it is easier to create a Windows Installer installation for an application by using one of the commercial package-creation tools available from independent software vendors.

## Windows Installer Software Vendors

You can contact an independent software vendor about tools to create a Windows Installer package for an application. These tools can provide a package authoring environment that may be easier to use than the tools provided in the Windows Installer SDK.
