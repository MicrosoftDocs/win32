# Summary Information Stream

The material in this section is intended for developers who are writing their own setup programs who want to learn more about Windows Installer database tables. For general information, see [About Windows Installer](about-windows-installer.md).

The summary information stream is used by the installer for two purposes. First, it contains information about the package that can be viewed through Microsoft Windows Explorer. This information is accessible through the **IStream** interface. Second, it contains properties that are used by the installer to install the package. The following topics provide information about how to use the summary information stream with the installer:

-   [About the Summary Information Stream](about-the-summary-information-stream.md)
-   [Using the Summary Information Stream](using-the-summary-information-stream.md)
-   [Summary Information Stream Reference](summary-information-stream-reference.md)
