# ListView Control

The ListView control that displays a single column of values with an icon next to each item. It enables the user to select a single string or integer value for a property from a predetermined list. The possible values are read from the [ListView table](listview-table.md). You can associate the control with an integer or string value by entering the property's name into the Property column of the [Control table](control-table.md).

The contents of the Text field of the [Control table](control-table.md) is never displayed by the ListView control. Instead this field specifies the style of text to be displayed by the control and contains a description of the control used by screen review utilities. To set the font and font style of a text string, prefix the string of displayed characters with {\\style} or {&*style*}. Where style is an identifier listed in the TextStyle column of the [TextStyle table](textstyle-table.md). If neither of these are present, but the [**DefaultUIFont**](defaultuifont.md) property is defined as a valid text style, that font will be used. The information following this is read by screen review utilities as the description of the control. See [Accessibility](accessibility.md).

## Control Attributes

You can use the following attributes with this control. To change the value of an attribute using an event, subscribe the control to a ControlEvent in the [EventMapping table](eventmapping-table.md) and list the attribute's identifier in the Attribute column. Enter the identifier of the ControlEvent in the Event column.

## Remarks

This control can be created from the WC\_LISTVIEW class by using the [**CreateWindowEx**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-createwindowexa) function. It has the **LVS\_REPORT**, **LVS\_NOCOLUMNHEADER**, **WS\_VSCROLL**, **WS\_HSCROLL**, **LVS\_SHAREIMAGELISTS**, **LVS\_SINGLESEL**, **LVS\_SHOWSELALWAYS**, **WS\_BORDER**, and **WS\_TABSTOP** styles. If the Sorted style bit is not on, the control also has the **LVS\_SORTASCENDING** style.

For compatibility with screen readers, when authoring a dialog with an ListView control as the first active control, you must make the text field belonging to the edit field the first active control in the [Dialog table](dialog-table.md). Since the static text cannot take focus, when the dialog is created the edit field will have the focus initially as intended, but doing this ensures that screen readers show the correct information.
