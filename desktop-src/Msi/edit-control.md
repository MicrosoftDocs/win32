# Edit Control (Windows Installer)

The Edit control is an edit field that is associated with a string or integer value property. Enter the property's name into the Property column of the [Control table](control-table.md).

## Control Attributes

You can use the following attributes with this control. To change the value of an attribute using an event, subscribe the control to a ControlEvent in the [EventMapping table](eventmapping-table.md) and list the attribute's identifier in the Attribute column. Enter the identifier of the ControlEvent in the Event column.



| Attribute identifier                                               | Hexadecimal bit                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Add 2097152 to the value in the Attributes column of the [Control table](control-table.md) to create an edit control that displays each character as an asterisk (\*) as they are typed into the control. Setting the Password Attribute prevents the installer from writing the property associated with the Edit control into the log file.

## Remarks

This control can be created from the EDIT class by using the [**CreateWindowEx**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-createwindowexa) function. It has the **WS\_BORDER**, **WS\_CHILD**, **WS\_TABSTOP**, and **WS\_GROUP** styles.

The length of text that can be entered can be limited by putting a number from 0 to 2147483646 in curly braces at the beginning of the Text field in the [Control table](control-table.md). For example, if the text field starts with {80}, the length of the string is limited at 80 characters. If no such limit is supplied in the table, or if 0 is specified, the length is set to the maximum possible (2147483646 characters). A negative or non-numeric value will generate an error.

For compatibility with screen readers, when authoring a dialog box with an Edit control as the first active control, you must make the text field belonging to the edit field the first active control in the [Dialog table](dialog-table.md). Since the static text cannot take focus, when the dialog box is created the edit field will have the focus initially as intended, but doing this ensures that screen readers show the correct information.

The property associated with the Edit control is only set when the control loses focus. Therefore you must tab from the control or select a different control for the property to be updated.
