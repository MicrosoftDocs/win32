# FatalError Dialog

This modal dialog box displays at the end of an installation, if the installation is terminated because of a fatal error. This dialog box typically contains only some text and an **OK** button. The name of this dialog box must appear in the [AdminUISequence table](adminuisequence-table.md) and [InstallUISequence table](installuisequence-table.md) with -3 as the sequence number.
