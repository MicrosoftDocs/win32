# TimeRemaining Control Attribute

This attribute enables a text control to display the approximate number of minutes and seconds remaining for an installation. A record passed to the text control contains one integer representing the number of seconds remaining. The text control searches the [UIText table](uitext-table.md) for a string named TimeRemaining and formats the integer into an appropriate string displaying minutes and seconds.

## Valid Controls

[Text](text-control.md)

## Associated Bit Flags

This attribute does not use bit flags.

## Remarks

See [Control Attributes](control-attributes.md) and the control you need to create under [Controls](controls.md).
