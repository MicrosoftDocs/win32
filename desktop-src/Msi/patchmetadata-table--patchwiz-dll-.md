# PatchMetadata Table (PATCHWIZ.DLL)

The PatchMetadata Table contains information about a Windows Installer patch that is required to remove a patch and that is used by Add/Remove Programs. All the properties in the PatchMetadata Table are added to the [MsiPatchMetadata Table](msipatchmetadata-table.md) of the .msp file for a patch.

The PatchMetadata Table is required in patch creation properties files (.pcp files) that have a MinimumRequiredMsiVersion equal to 300 in the [Properties Table](properties-table-patchwiz-dll-.md). The table is optional if MinimumRequiredMsiVersion is not equal to 300.

The PatchMetadata Table has the following columns.
