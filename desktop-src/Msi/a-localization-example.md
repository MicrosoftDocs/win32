# A Localization Example

This example illustrates how to localize the Windows Installer package described in [An Installation Example](an-installation-example.md). The original installation package is changed from an English into French language version.

The localization sample has the following specifications:

-   The installation UI for the application MNP2000 should be changed from English to French.
-   The French version of MNP2000 includes Readme.txt and Help.txt files written in the French language.
-   The French version includes a list of travel agents in France that can provide tickets to Red Park Arena. This list (provided as a new file, Fre.txt) is not a part of the English version.

The general procedure for localizing an installation is described in the section [Localizing a Windows Installer Package](localizing-a-windows-installer-package.md).

Copy the English version of MNP2000.msi and all the source files described in [Planning the Installation](planning-the-installation.md) into a new folder. Change the name of the MNP2000.msi in the folder to MNPFren.msi. In the following sections you will modify this copy to localize the application into French.
