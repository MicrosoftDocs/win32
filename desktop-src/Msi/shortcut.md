# Shortcut

The Shortcut data type is usually used in the Target column of the [Shortcut table](shortcut-table.md). If it contains square brackets (\[ \]), the shortcut target is evaluated as a Formatted string. Otherwise, the shortcut is evaluated as an [Identifier](identifier.md) and must be a valid foreign key into the [Feature table](feature-table.md).
