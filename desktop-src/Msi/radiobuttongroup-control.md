# RadioButtonGroup Control

The RadioButtonGroup control is a group of radio buttons. It enables the user to select a string or integer value for a property from a predetermined list of values. You can associate this control with a property by entering the property's name into the Property column of the [Control table](control-table.md). Specify the possible values for selection in the Value column of the [RadioButton table](radiobutton-table.md). Note that the string displayed is not necessarily the same as the value that the user is choosing.

Every RadioButtonGroup control is associated with a property. The default value for this property must be initialized in the [Property table](property-table.md). Within each RadioButtonGroup specified in the [RadioButton table](radiobutton-table.md), there may be one radio button that has a value in the Value field that matches the default value for this property. This is the default button for the RadioButtonGroup control. The **Default** button is initially shown as selected in the control.

Note that the focus on a dialog box cannot move to a RadioButtonGroup control until one of the buttons in the group has been selected. To make the focus move to this button group, specify one of the buttons as a default button for the group.

RadioButtonGroup controls only set property values and cannot be used to send a [ControlEvent](control-events.md).

The implementation treats the whole group as one control, therefore it is not possible to hide or disable individual buttons within the group. Similarly all the buttons have to be of the same style, that is, either all of them have text or all of them have bitmaps (or other similar features). The position of the buttons is authored relative to the group. This way the entire group can be moved by changing only the coordinates of the group without changing the individual buttons. At creation the control verifies that the individual buttons do not extend beyond the boundaries of the group.

## Control Attributes

You can use the following attributes with this control. To change the value of an attribute using an event, subscribe the control to a ControlEvent in the [EventMapping table](eventmapping-table.md) and list the attribute's identifier in the Attribute column. Enter the identifier of the ControlEvent in the Event column.

## Remarks

Because of the way Windows draws the frame, there is a gap between the top of the control's window and the visible frame, even when there is no caption.

This control can be created from the BUTTON class by using the [**CreateWindowEx**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-createwindowexa) function. If the [HasBorder](hasborder-control-attribute.md) bit is set, it has the **BS\_GROUPBOX** style, otherwise it has the **BS\_OWNERDRAW** style.

The RadioButtonGroup control should not overlap other controls and other controls should not overlap a RadioButtonGroup. Overlapping this control and another can cause the controls to function or display incorrectly. To provide screen-reader programs with extra descriptive text about a RadioButtonGroup control, follow the example provided in [Adding Extra Text to Radio Buttons](adding-extra-text-to-radio-buttons.md).
