| ICEM                 | Brief description of Merge Module ICE                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| [ICEM01](icem01.md) | Validates that the ICE mechanism is working.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [ICEM02](icem02.md) | Validates that all module exclusions and dependencies relate to the current module.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [ICEM03](icem03.md) | Validates that all actions in the module are either base actions or derive from a base action.                                                                                                                                                           |
| [ICEM04](icem04.md) | Verifies that the merge module's required empty tables are indeed empty.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [ICEM05](icem05.md) | Checks for invalid associations with components.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [ICEM06](icem06.md) | Checks for invalid references to features by the module.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [ICEM07](icem07.md) | Validates that the order of files in the sequence tables and in [MergeModule.CABinet](mergemodule-cabinet.md) file match.                                                                                                                               |
| [ICEM08](icem08.md) | Ensures that a module does not exclude something it depends on.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [ICEM09](icem09.md) | Verifies that the merge module safely handles predefined directories.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [ICEM10](icem10.md) | Verifies that a merge module does not contain disallowed properties in the [Property Table](property-table.md).                                                                                                                                         |
| [ICEM11](icem11.md) | Verifies that a Configurable Merge Module lists the [ModuleConfiguration table](moduleconfiguration-table.md) and [ModuleSubstitution table](modulesubstitution-table.md) in the [ModuleIgnoreTable table](moduleignoretable-table.md) of the module. |
| [ICEM12](icem12.md) | Verifies that in a ModuleSequence table, standard actions have Sequence numbers and custom actions have BaseAction and After values.                                                                                                                     |
| [ICEM13](icem13.md) | Verifies that publisher policy and configuration assemblies are not included in the merge module.                                                                                                                                                        |
| [ICEM14](icem14.md) | Validates the Value Column of the [ModuleSubstitution table](modulesubstitution-table.md).                                                                                                                                                              |
