# Exit Dialog

The Exit dialog box is displayed at the end of a successful installation. This dialog box typically contains only some text and an **OK** button. The name of this dialog box must appear in the [AdminUISequence table](adminuisequence-table.md) and [InstallUISequence table](installuisequence-table.md) with -1 as the sequence number. This is a modal dialog box.
