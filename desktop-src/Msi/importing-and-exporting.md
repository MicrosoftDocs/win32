# Importing and Exporting

You can use the installer to import a text archive into an active database as well as to export a database file to a text archive. This can be useful for text-based source control systems.

To import a text archive into an active database, call the [**MsiDatabaseImport**](/windows/desktop/api/Msiquery/nf-msiquery-msidatabaseimporta) function.

To export a database file to a text archive, call the [**MsiDatabaseExport**](/windows/desktop/api/Msiquery/nf-msiquery-msidatabaseexporta) function.
