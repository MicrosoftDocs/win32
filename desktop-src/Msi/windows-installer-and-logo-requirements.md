# Windows Installer and Logo Requirements

The Certified for Microsoft Windows Logo identifies products that have been verified through independent testing to comply with the Application Specification for Windows. This specification was developed by Microsoft in cooperation with customers and other developers to provide a road map for building reliable and manageable applications. Software vendors who comply with the specification qualify for the Certified for Microsoft Windows logo and then license the logo for use on their product packaging, advertising, collateral, and other marketing materials.

For more information about Windows Vista, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2008 certification for your applications, see the [Microsoft Partner Network]( https://partner.microsoft.com).

For more information about the Windows Server 2003 and Windows 2000 certification for your applications, see [https://msdn.microsoft.com/certification](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/partners/isvs/cfw.mspx).

If you are authoring an installation package for your application, you may take advantage of the capabilities of the Microsoft Windows Installer to help satisfy several of the requirements for certification. The following table provides links to information in Windows Installer documentation pertinent for some of the certification requirements. Note that the not every requirement for certification discussed in the Application Specification is dependent upon Windows Installer.

| 1.5 The application should not read from or write to Win.ini, System.ini, Autoexec.bat or Config.sys.<br/>                                                            | Your installation program should add entries to the registry *not* to the Win.ini, System.ini, Autoexec.bat or Config.sys. Windows Installer supports informational keys in the registry. When your application uses the installer, these registry keys become available as installer properties. You can author the package for your application such that it is easy to check and set the values of these keys. If your application uses information that you do not want to put in the registry, create a private initialization file and place it in the directory with the application's executable files. You can easily manage the installation of a private .ini file, as well as add or remove information from existing .ini files, by using Windows Installer to install your application.

On initialization, the installer automatically sets certain properties to the version of the current operating system. Your setup program can use these installer properties to provide easy version checking.

| 2.1 The application should install using a Windows Installer package that passes validation testing.<br/>                                                             | You can check that your installation package passes validation testing by using a specific set of validation rules known as [Internal Consistency Evaluators - ICEs](internal-consistency-evaluators-ices.md). These ICEs are contained in the file Logo.cub. To qualify for certification, an installation package must not produce any errors when validated using these rules. Warnings are acceptable, but generally should be corrected. The Windows Installer SDK includes the Logo.cub, Darice.cub, and Mergemod.cub files. The ICEs in the Logo.cub file are included in the Darice.cub file. If your package passes validation using Darice.cub, it will pass with Logo.cub.

There is a set of rules to help you decide how best to divide your application into components. If the components in your installation package are correctly defined, the installer can install and remove them safely.

If you do not use the installer, then your application must keep track of its use of shared DLLs by incrementing a usage counter for the DLL in the SharedDLLs registry key.

You can then author your Windows Installer package such that the installer checks the user's access privileges before installation begins.<br/> You can author the installation package so that the installer determines whether there is sufficient disk space.
