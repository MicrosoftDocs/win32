Target applications include video or framerate-based presentation applications. Applications using Direct3D 9Ex Flip Mode Present reduce the system resource load when DWM is enabled. Present Statistics enhancements associated with Flip Mode Present enable Direct3D 9Ex applications to better control the rate of presentation by providing real-time feedback and correction mechanisms. Detailed explanations and pointers to sample resources are included.<br/> |
