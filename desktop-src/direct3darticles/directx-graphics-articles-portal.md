# DirectX Graphics Articles

## Purpose

This section contains technical articles that describe WARP and Windows 7's newly added support for Flip Mode Present and its associated Present Statistics in Direct3D 9Ex and Desktop Window Manager. This section also contains technical articles about Windows graphics APIs, porting Direct3D 9 APIs to Microsoft DirectX Graphics Infrastructure (DXGI) APIs, and how to deploy Direct3D 11.

For more information about Direct3D, see [Direct3D](/windows/desktop/direct3d).

## Developer audience

These technical articles are for DirectX graphics application developers.

## In this section

| Topic | Description |
|-|-|
| [Platform Update for Windows 7](platform-update-for-windows-7.md) | Describes what components of the Windows 8 graphics stack become available, and to what extent, through the [Platform Update for Windows 7](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2670838). |
| [Direct3D 9Ex Improvements](direct3d-9ex-improvements.md) | Describes Windows 7's newly added support for Flip Mode Present and its associated Present Statistics in Direct3D 9Ex and Desktop Window Manager. Target applications include video or framerate-based presentation applications. Applications using Direct3D 9Ex Flip Mode Present reduce the system resource load when DWM is enabled. Present Statistics enhancements associated with Flip Mode Present enable Direct3D 9Ex applications to better control the rate of presentation by providing real-time feedback and correction mechanisms. Detailed explanations and pointers to sample resources are included. |
| [Surface Sharing Between Windows Graphics APIs](surface-sharing-between-windows-graphics-apis.md) | Provides a technical overview of interoperability using surface sharing between Windows graphics APIs, including Direct3D 11, Direct2D, Direct3D 10, and Direct3D 9Ex. If you already have a working knowledge of these APIs, this paper can help you use multiple APIs to render to the same surface in an application designed for the Windows 7 or Windows Vista operating systems. This topic also provides best practice guidelines and pointers to additional resources. |
| [WARP Guide](directx-warp.md) | Provides a guide of Windows Advanced Rasterization Platform (WARP), a high speed software rasterizer. |
| [Graphics APIs in Windows](graphics-apis-in-windows-vista.md) | Discusses Windows graphics features and APIs. |
| [Direct3D 11 Deployment for Game Developers](direct3d11-deployment.md) | Describes how to deploy the Direct3D 11 components on a system. |
| [DirectX Graphics Infrastructure (DXGI): Best Practices](dxgi-best-practices.md) | Discusses issues about porting Direct3D 9 APIs to DXGI APIs and features of various versions of DXGI. |
| [Using DirectX with high dynamic range displays and advanced color](high-dynamic-range.md) | This topic provides a technical overview of rendering high dynamic range Direct3D 11 and Direct3D 12 content to an HDR10 display using Windows 10 advanced color support. |
