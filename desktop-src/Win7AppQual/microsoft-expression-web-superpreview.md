# Microsoft Expression Web SuperPreview

Microsoft Expression Web SuperPreview for Internet Explorer is a stand-alone visual debugging tool that helps you debug your websites for cross-browser compatibility. Web SuperPreview ensures that your sites work correctly in Windows Internet Explorer 8 and maintains compatibility with earlier versions of Windows Internet Explorer.

Web SuperPreview shows how your webpages render in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and either Windows Internet Explorer 7 or Internet Explorer 8, depending on which version you install on your computer. You can view the pages side-by-side, or as an overlay. You can use rulers, guides, and zoom and pan tools to precisely identify differences in layout. You can even compare your page to how the targeted browsers render the page.

Web SuperPreview also identifies an element’s tag, size, position, applied styles, and location in the Document Object Model (DOM) tree so you can quickly fix the error.

> [!Note]  
> Web SuperPreview is a free application that has no expiration and no technical support from Microsoft.

 

With the Web SuperPreview tool, you can:

-   Debug pages on your development computer. Web SuperPreview works directly with installed Microsoft Windows browsers and includes the Internet Explorer 6 rendering engine. You can use this engine side-by-side together with other versions of Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox.
-   Debug more quickly by using element and DOM tree information. Web SuperPreview also combines image rendering with DOM data, so you can highlight specific DOM elements within the image and show differences across browsers. The tool provides element information such as position, dimensions, and ID to help you find the element that is causing the compatibility issue.
-   Support Windows and Macintosh browsers, including Internet Explorer 6 and later versions, Firefox 3.6, and Macintosh Safari.
