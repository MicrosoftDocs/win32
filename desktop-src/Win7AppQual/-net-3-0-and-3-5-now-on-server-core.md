# .NET 3.0 and 3.5 Now on Server Core

## Platform

**Servers** - Windows Server 2008 R2  



## Feature Impact

 **Severity** - Low  
**Frequency** - Low  





## Description

The Server Core installation option for Windows Server 2008 R2 now includes a subset of the .NET Framework 3.0 and 3.5, specifically WCF, WF, LINQ.

There was no .NET support in the Server Core installation option for Windows Server 2008.

## Manifestation of Impact

This allows some WCF and WF based applications as well as applications that use LINQ to run on Server Core in Windows Server 2008 R2.

## Testing

Test applications that incorporate WCF, WF, and LINQ code on Server Core.
