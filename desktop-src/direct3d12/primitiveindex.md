# PrimitiveIndex function

Retrieves the autogenerated index of the primitive within the geometry inside the bottom-level acceleration structure instance.

## Syntax

```
uint PrimitiveIndex();
```

## Remarks

For **D3D12\_RAYTRACING\_GEOMETRY\_TYPE\_TRIANGLES**, this is the triangle index within the geometry object.

For **D3D12\_RAYTRACING\_GEOMETRY\_TYPE\_PROCEDURAL\_PRIMITIVE\_AABBS**, this is the index into the AABB array defining the geometry object.

This function can be called from the following raytracing shader types:

* [**Any Hit Shader**](any-hit-shader.md)
* [**Closest Hit Shader**](closest-hit-shader.md)
* [**Intersection Shader**](intersection-shader.md)
