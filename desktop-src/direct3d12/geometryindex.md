# GeometryIndex function

The autogenerated index of the current geometry in the bottom-level acceleration structure.

## Syntax


```C++
uint GeometryIndex();
```

## Remarks

This method is only available on [Tier 1.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/dxr-1-1/) implementations.

The MultiplierForGeometryContributionToHitGroupIndex parameter to [TraceRay()](traceray-function.md) can be set to 0 to stop the geometry index from contributing to shader table indexing if the shader just wants to rely on GeometryIndex() to distinguish geometries.
