# Raytracing HLSL Intrinsics

The following HLSL intrinisc functions support the Direct3D 12 raytracing pipeline. 

## In this section



| Topic | Description |
|-|-|
| [**AcceptHitAndEndSearch function**](accepthitandendsearch-function.md) | Used in an any hit shader to commit the current hit and then stop searching for more hits for the ray. |
| [**CallShader function**](callshader-function.md) | Invokes another shader from within a shader. |
| [**IgnoreHit function**](ignorehit-function.md) | Called from an any hit shader to reject the hit and end the shader. |
| [**PrimitiveIndex function**](primitiveindex.md) | Retrieves the autogenerated index of the primitive within the geometry inside the bottom-level acceleration structure instance. |
| [**ReportHit function**](reporthit-function.md) | Called by an intersection shader to report a ray intersection. |
| [**TraceRay function**](traceray-function.md) | Sends a ray into a search for hits in an acceleration structure. |
