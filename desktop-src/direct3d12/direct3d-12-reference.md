# Direct3D 12 reference

This section covers APIs for Direct3D 12-based graphics programming.

## In this section

| Topic | Description |
|-|-|
| [Interface hierarchy](interface-hierarchy.md) | The diagram shows the interface inheritance hierarchy. |
| [Example code in the D3D12 reference](notes-on-example-code.md) | Explains the use of example code in the Direct3D 12 documentation. |
| [Core reference](direct3d-12-core-reference.md) | This section covers Direct3D 12 APIs declared in d3d12.h, including APIs for buffers, textures, and views. |
| [Debug layer reference](direct3d-12-sdklayers-reference.md) | This section covers Direct3D 12 APIs declared in d3d12sdklayers.h, which is for the debug layer. |
| [Shader reference](d3d12-graphics-reference-shader-reference.md) | This section covers Direct3D 12 APIs declared in d3d12shader.h, which helps create and manage programmable shaders. Shaders are executable programs that are programmed exclusively using HLSL. |
| [11on12 reference](direct3d-11on12-reference.md) | This section covers Direct3D 12 APIs declared in d3d11on12.h. The Direct3D 11on12 APIs help you port code incrementally from D3D11 to D3D12. |
| [Direct Machine Learning (DirectML) reference](direct3d-directml-reference.md) | This section covers Direct Machine Learning (DirectML) APIs declared in directml.h. |
| [Helper structures and functions for D3D12](helper-structures-and-functions-for-d3d12.md) | These helper structures and helper functions are declared in `d3dx12.h`. |
| [Direct3D 12 return codes](d3d12-graphics-reference-returnvalues.md) | The following are return codes from API functions. |
| [Direct3D 12 Raytracing](direct3d-12-raytracing.md) | This section provides links to APIs that are relevant to Direct3D 12 Raytracing. |
| [Direct3D 12 On Windows 7](direct3d-12on7-reference.md) | This section covers Direct3D 12 APIs declared in `d3d12downlevel.h`, for use solely on Windows 7. See [Porting DirectX 12 games to Windows 7](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/porting-directx-12-games-to-windows-7/) for more details. |
