| [Conservative Rasterization](conservative-rasterization.md)<br/>                             | Conservative Rasterization adds some certainty to pixel rendering, which is helpful in particular to collision detection algorithms.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [Indirect Drawing](indirect-drawing.md)<br/>                                                 | Indirect drawing enables some scene-traversal and culling to be moved from the CPU to the GPU, which can improve performance. The command buffer can be generated by the CPU or GPU.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [Rasterizer Ordered Views](rasterizer-order-views.md)<br/>                                   | Rasterizer ordered views (ROVs) allow pixel shader code to mark UAV bindings with a declaration that alters the normal requirements for the order of graphics pipeline results for UAVs. This enables Order Independent Transparency (OIT) algorithms to work, which give much better rendering results when multiple transparent objects are in line with each other in a view. <br/> |
| [Shader Specified Stencil Reference Value](shader-specified-stencil-reference-value.md)<br/> | Enabling pixel shaders to output the Stencil Reference Value, rather than using the API-specified one, enables a very fine granular control over stencil operations.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [Swap Chains](swap-chains.md)<br/>                                                           | Swap chains control the back buffer rotation, forming the basis of graphics animation.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |



 

The following topics are also new to Direct3D 12 and Direct3D 11.3:

-   [Default Texture Mapping](default-texture-mapping.md)
-   [Typed Unordered Access View Loads](typed-unordered-access-view-loads.md)
-   [Volume Tiled Resources](volume-tiled-resources.md)

## High Dynamic Range and Wide Color Gamut

Refer to the support for High Dynamic Range (increased difference between the brightest whites and the darkest blacks), and Wide Color Gamut (10 bits, rather than 8 bits, per color) described in [DXGI 1.5 Improvements](/windows/desktop/direct3ddxgi/dxgi-1-5-improvements).
