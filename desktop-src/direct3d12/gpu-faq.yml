      - question: How do I enable DirectML acceleration? 
        answer: |
          The DirectML device is enabled by default, assuming you have an appropriate DirectX 12 GPU available. TensorFlow operations will automatically be assigned to the DirectML device if possible. 
          
          If you're having trouble determining whether your model is running using DirectML acceleration or not, you can put `tf.debugging.set_log_device_placement(True)` as the first statement of your program and TensorFlow will print device placement information to the console.
          
      - question: How do I control device placement of specific operations? 
        answer: |
          As with any other device (see [TensorFlow Guide: Use a GPU](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/gpu)), you can use `tf.device()` to control which device to run on. 
           
          
          The DirectML device string is `'DML'`. 
          
          
          ```python 
          
          import tensorflow as tf 

          tf.debugging.set_log_device_placement(True) 

          tf.enable_eager_execution() 

 

          # Explicitly place tensors on the DirectML device 

          with tf.device('/DML:0'): 

            a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) 

            b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0]) 

 

          c = tf.add(a, b) 

          print(c)
          ```          

          ```
          Executing op Add in device /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:DML:0 

          tf.Tensor([5. 7. 9.], shape=(3,), dtype=float32)
          ```
          
      - question: I have multiple GPUs. How do I select which one is used by DirectML?
        answer: |
          There are a couple of different ways to do this, depending on whether you want to control it process-wide or per-session (or both).
          
          If you want to control which devices are visible to TensorFlow process-wide, use the `DML_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable. If you want to control it on a per-session basis, use `tf.GPUOptions.visible_device_list`.
          
      - question: How do I use the `DML_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to control which GPU(s) get used by DirectML?
        answer: |
          TensorFlow with DirectML supports a `DML_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable, which takes the form of a comma-separated list of device IDs (also known as "adapter indices".) When set, only the device IDs in that list will be visible to TensorFlow process-wide. Devices excluded using `DML_VISIBLE_DEVICES` will not appear in the list of physical devices available to TensorFlow.
          
          ```python
          import tensorflow as tf
          tf.debugging.set_log_device_placement(True)
          tf.enable_eager_execution()
          
          a = tf.constant([1.])
          b = tf.constant([2.])
          c = tf.add(a, b)
          print(c)
          ```
          
          Here is example output **without** `DML_VISIBLE_DEVICES` set:
          
          ```
          DirectML device enumeration: found 2 compatible adapters.
          DirectML: creating device on adapter 0 (NVIDIA TITAN V)
          DirectML: creating device on adapter 1 (AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT)
          Executing op Add in device /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:DML:0
          tf.Tensor([3.], shape=(1,), dtype=float32)
          ```
          
          With `DML_VISIBLE_DEVICES="1"`:
          
          ```
          DirectML device enumeration: found 1 compatible adapters.
          DirectML: creating device on adapter 0 (AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT)
          Executing op Add in device /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:DML:0
          tf.Tensor([3.], shape=(1,), dtype=float32)
          ```
          
          Note that by restricting the visible devices to only index 1 (AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT), TensorFlow now assigns an ID of 0 to this device, and makes it the default.
          
          You may also re-order devices using this environment variable. For example, setting `DML_VISIBLE_DEVICES="1,0"`:
          
          ```
          DirectML device enumeration: found 2 compatible adapters.
          DirectML: creating device on adapter 0 (AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT)
          DirectML: creating device on adapter 1 (NVIDIA TITAN V)
          Executing op Add in device /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:DML:0
          tf.Tensor([3.], shape=(1,), dtype=float32)
          ```
          
          Notice that the two GPUs (NVIDIA TITAN V and AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT) have now switched places.
          
          To prevent specific devices from being visible, you can supply an invalid ID (e.g. `-1`) in the comma-separated list. All device IDs after the invalid entry are ignored. You can also use this to disable DirectML acceleration altogether.
          
          `DML_VISIBLE_DEVICES="-1"`:
          
          ```
          DirectML device enumeration: found 0 compatible adapters.
          Executing op Add in device /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0
          tf.Tensor([3.], shape=(1,), dtype=float32)
          ```
          
      - question: How do I use the `visible_device_list` session option to control which GPU(s) DirectML uses to run the session?
        answer: |
          Similar to `DML_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, you can also set a similar string to control visible devices at a session level. The `visible_device_list` attribute is available on the `GPUOptions` class when creating your TensorFlow session.
          
          ```python
          import tensorflow as tf
          
          a = tf.constant([1.])
          b = tf.constant([2.])
          c = tf.add(a, b)
          
          gpu_config = tf.GPUOptions()
          gpu_config.visible_device_list = "1"
          
          session = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(gpu_options=gpu_config))
          print(session.run(c))
          ```
          
          ```

          You can read the [TensorFlow GPUOptions API reference](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/GPUOptions#visible_device_list) for more details.
