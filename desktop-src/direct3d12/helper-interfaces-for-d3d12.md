# Helper interfaces for Direct3D 12

These helper interfaces help particularly in handling subresources, and are declared in `d3dx12.h`.

`d3dx12.h` is available separately from the Direct3D 12 headers. You can download `d3dx12.h` from [The D3D12 Helper Library](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/tree/master/Libraries/D3DX12).
