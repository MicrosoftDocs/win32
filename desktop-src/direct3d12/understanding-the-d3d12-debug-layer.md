| [Use GPU-based validation with the Direct3D 12 Debug Layer](using-d3d12-debug-layer-gpu-based-validation.md) | This topic describes how to make best use of the Direct3D 12 Debug Layer. GPU-based validation (GBV) enables validation scenarios on the GPU timeline that are not possible during API calls on the CPU. |
| [Use DRED to diagnose GPU faults](use-dred.md) | Device Removed Extended Data (DRED) is an evolving set of diagnostic features designed to help you to identify the cause of unexpected device removal errors. |
