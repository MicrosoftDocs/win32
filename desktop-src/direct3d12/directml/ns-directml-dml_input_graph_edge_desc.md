# DML_INPUT_GRAPH_EDGE_DESC structure (directml.h)
Describes a connection within a graph of DirectML operators defined by [DML_GRAPH_DESC](/windows/desktop/direct3d12/directml/ns-directml-dml_graph_desc) and passed to [IDMLDevice1::CompileGraph](/windows/desktop/direct3d12/directml/nf-directml-idmldevice1-compilegraph). This structure is used to define a connection from a graph input to an input of an internal node.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/). Also see [DirectML version history](/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-version-history).

## Syntax
```cpp
struct DML_INPUT_GRAPH_EDGE_DESC {
  UINT       GraphInputIndex;
  UINT       ToNodeIndex;
  UINT       ToNodeInputIndex;
  const char *Name;
};
```



## Members

`GraphInputIndex`

Type: **[UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)**

The index of the graph input from which a connection to an internal node input is specified.


`ToNodeIndex`

Type: **[UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)**

The index of the internal node onto which the connection from the graph input is specified.


`ToNodeInputIndex`

Type: **[UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)**

The index of the input on the internal node where the connection is specified.


`Name`

Type: \_Field\_z\_ \_Maybenull\_ **const char\***

An optional name for the graph connection. If provided, this might be used within certain error messages emitted by the DirectML debug layer.

## Availability

This API was introduced in DirectML version `1.1.0`.
