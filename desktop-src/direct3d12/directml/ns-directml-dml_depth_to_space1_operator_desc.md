# DML_DEPTH_TO_SPACE1_OPERATOR_DESC structure (directml.h)

Rearranges (permutes) data from depth into blocks of spatial data. The operator outputs a copy of the input tensor where values from the depth dimension are moved in spatial blocks to the height and width dimensions.

This is the inverse transformation of [DML_SPACE_TO_DEPTH1_OPERATOR_DESC](./ns-directml-dml_space_to_depth1_operator_desc.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/) version 1.4 and later. Also see [DirectML version history](../dml-version-history.md).

## Syntax
```cpp
struct DML_DEPTH_TO_SPACE1_OPERATOR_DESC {
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *InputTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *OutputTensor;
  UINT                  BlockSize;
  DML_DEPTH_SPACE_ORDER Order;
};
```



## Members

`InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to read from. The input tensor's dimensions are `{ BatchCount, InputChannelCount, InputHeight, InputWidth }`.


`OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to write the results to. The output tensor's dimensions are `{ BatchCount, OutputChannelCount, OutputHeight, OutputWidth }`, where:

* OutputChannelCount is computed as InputChannelCount / (`BlockSize` * `BlockSize`)
* OutputHeight is computed as InputHeight * `BlockSize`
* OutputWidth is computed as InputWidth * `BlockSize`


`BlockSize`

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The width and height of the blocks that are moved.


`Order`

Type: **[DML_DEPTH_SPACE_ORDER](./ne-directml-dml_depth_space_order.md)**

See [DML_DEPTH_SPACE_ORDER](./ne-directml-dml_depth_space_order.md).

## Examples

The examples in this section all use the input below.

```
InputTensor: (Sizes:{1, 8, 2, 3}, DataType:UINT32)
[[[[0,   1,  2],
   [3,   4,  5]],
  [[9,  10, 11],
   [12, 13, 14]],
  [[18, 19, 20],
   [21, 22, 23]],
  [[27, 28, 29],
   [30, 31, 32]],
  [[36, 37, 38],
   [39, 40, 41]],
  [[45, 46, 47],
   [48, 49, 50]],
  [[54, 55, 56],
   [57, 58, 59]],
  [[63, 64, 65],
   [66, 67, 68]]]]
```

### Example 1. Depth-column-row order

```
BlockSize: 2
Order: DML_DEPTH_SPACE_ORDER_DEPTH_COLUMN_ROW
OutputTensor: (Sizes:{1, 2, 4, 6}, DataType:UINT32)
 [[[[ 0, 18,  1, 19,  2, 20],
    [36, 54, 37, 55, 38, 56],
    [ 3, 21,  4, 22,  5, 23],
    [39, 57, 40, 58, 41, 59]],
   [[ 9, 27, 10, 28, 11, 29],
    [45, 63, 46, 64, 47, 65],
    [12, 30, 13, 31, 14, 32],
    [48, 66, 49, 67, 50, 68]]]]
```

### Example 2. Column-row-depth order

```
BlockSize: 2
Order: DML_DEPTH_SPACE_ORDER_COLUMN_ROW_DEPTH
OutputTensor: (Sizes:{1, 2, 4, 6}, DataType:UINT32)
[[[[ 0,  9,  1, 10,  2, 11],
   [18, 27, 19, 28, 20, 29],
   [ 3, 12,  4, 13,  5, 14],
   [21, 30, 22, 31, 23, 32]],
  [[36, 45, 37, 46, 38, 47],
   [54, 63, 55, 64, 56, 65],
   [39, 48, 40, 49, 41, 50],
   [57, 66, 58, 67, 59, 68]]]]
```


## Remarks
When *Order* is set to [DML_DEPTH_SPACE_ORDER_DEPTH_COLUMN_ROW](./ne-directml-dml_depth_space_order.md), **DML_DEPTH_TO_SPACE1_OPERATOR_DESC** is equivalent to [DML_DEPTH_TO_SPACE_OPERATOR_DESC]().

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_1`.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*.

## Tensor support
| Tensor | Kind | Dimensions | Supported dimension counts | Supported data types |
| ------ | ---- | ---------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| InputTensor | Input | { BatchCount, InputChannelCount, InputHeight, InputWidth } | 4 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16, INT32, INT16, INT8, UINT32, UINT16, UINT8 |
| OutputTensor | Output | { BatchCount, OutputChannelCount, OutputHeight, OutputWidth } | 4 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16, INT32, INT16, INT8, UINT32, UINT16, UINT8 |
