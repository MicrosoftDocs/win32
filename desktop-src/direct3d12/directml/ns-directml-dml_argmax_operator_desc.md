# DML_ARGMAX_OPERATOR_DESC structure (directml.h)

Outputs the indices of the maximum-valued elements within one or more dimensions of the input tensor.

Each output element is the result of applying an *argmax* reduction on a subset of the input tensor. The *argmax* function outputs the index of the maximum-valued element within a set of input elements. The input elements involved in each reduction are determined by the provided input axes. Similarly, each output index is with respect to the provided input axes. If all input axes are specified, then the operator applies a single *argmax* reduction, and produces a single output element.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/). Also see [DirectML version history](/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-version-history).

## Syntax
```cpp
struct DML_ARGMAX_OPERATOR_DESC
{
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC* InputTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC* OutputTensor;
  UINT AxisCount;
  _Field_size_(AxisCount) const UINT* Axes;
  DML_AXIS_DIRECTION AxisDirection;
};
```

## Members

`InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to read from.

`OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to write the results to. Each output element is the result of an *argmax* reduction on a subset of elements from the *InputTensor*. 

- *DimensionCount* must match *InputTensor.DimensionCount* (the rank of the input tensor is preserved).
- *Sizes* must match *InputTensor.Sizes*, except for dimensions included in the reduced *Axes*, which must be size 1.

`AxisCount`

Type: **[UINT](/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

The number of axes to reduce. This field determines the size of the *Axes* array.

`Axes`

Type: \_Field_size\_(AxisCount) **const [UINT](/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)\***

The axes along which to reduce. Values must be in the range `[0, InputTensor.DimensionCount - 1]`.

`AxisDirection`

Type: **[DML_AXIS_DIRECTION](/windows/win32/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_axis_direction)**

Determines which index to select when multiple input elements have the same value.
- **DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_INCREASING** returns the index of the first maximum-valued element (for example, `argmax({3,2,1,2,3}) = 0`)
- **DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_DECREASING** returns the index of the last maximum-valued element (for example, `argmax({3,2,1,2,3}) = 4`)

## Examples

The examples in this section all use this same two-dimensional input tensor.

```
InputTensor: (Sizes:{3, 3}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[1, 2, 3],
 [3, 0, 4],
 [2, 5, 2]]
```

### Example 1. Applying *argmax* to columns

```
AxisCount: 1
Axes: {0}
AxisDirection: DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_INCREASING
OutputTensor: (Sizes:{1, 3}, DataType:UINT32)
[[1,  // argmax({1, 3, 2})
  2,  // argmax({2, 0, 5})
  1]] // argmax({3, 4, 2})
```

### Example 2. Applying *argmax* to rows

```
AxisCount: 1
Axes: {1}
AxisDirection: DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_INCREASING
OutputTensor: (Sizes:{3, 1}, DataType:UINT32)
[[2], // argmax({1, 2, 3})
 [2], // argmax({3, 0, 4})
 [1]] // argmax({2, 5, 2})
```

### Example 3. Applying *argmax* to all axes (the entire tensor)

```
AxisCount: 2
Axes: {0, 1}
AxisDirection: DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_INCREASING
OutputTensor: (Sizes:{1, 1}, DataType:UINT32)
[[7]]  // argmin({1, 2, 3, 3, 0, 4, 2, 5, 2})
```

## Remarks
The output tensor sizes must be the same as the input tensor sizes, except for the reduced axes, which must be 1.

When *AxisDirection* is [DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_INCREASING](/windows/win32/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_axis_direction), this API is equivalent to [DML_REDUCE_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_reduce_operator_desc) with [DML_REDUCE_FUNCTION_ARGMAX](/windows/win32/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_reduce_function).

A subset of this functionality is exposed through the [DML_REDUCE_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_reduce_operator_desc) operator, and is supported on earlier DirectML feature levels.

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_3_0`.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DimensionCount*.

## Tensor support
| Tensor | Kind | Supported dimension counts | Supported data types |
| ------ | ---- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| InputTensor | Input | 1 to 8 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16, INT32, INT16, INT8, UINT32, UINT16, UINT8 |
| OutputTensor | Output | 1 to 8 | INT64, INT32, UINT64, UINT32 |
