# DML_GRAPH_NODE_DESC structure (directml.h)
A generic container for a node within a graph of DirectML operators defined by [DML_GRAPH_DESC](/windows/win32/direct3d12/directml/ns-directml-dml_graph_desc) and passed to [IDMLDevice1::CompileGraph](/windows/desktop/direct3d12/directml/nf-directml-idmldevice1-compilegraph).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/). Also see [DirectML version history](/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-version-history).

## Syntax
```cpp
struct DML_GRAPH_NODE_DESC {
  DML_GRAPH_NODE_TYPE Type;
  const void          *Desc;
};
```



## Members

`Type`

Type: **[DML_GRAPH_NODE_TYPE](/windows/win32/direct3d12/directml/ne-directml-dml_graph_node_type)**

The type of graph node. See [DML_GRAPH_NODE_TYPE](/windows/win32/direct3d12/directml/ne-directml-dml_graph_node_type) for available types.


`Desc`

Type: \_Field\_size\_(\_Inexpressible\_("Dependent on node type")) **const void\***

A pointer to the graph node description. The type of the pointed-to struct must match the value specified in *Type*.

## Availability

This API was introduced in DirectML version `1.1.0`.
