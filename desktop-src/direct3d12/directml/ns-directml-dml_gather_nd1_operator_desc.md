# DML_GATHER_ND1_OPERATOR_DESC structure (directml.h)

Gathers elements from the input tensor, using the indices tensor to remap indices to entire subblocks of the input. This operator performs the following pseudocode, where "..." represents a series of coordinates, with the exact behavior dependent on the batch, input, and indices dimension count.

```
output[batch, ...] = input[batch, indices[batch, ...], ...]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/). Also see [DirectML version history](/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-version-history).

## Syntax

```cpp
struct DML_GATHER_ND1_OPERATOR_DESC
{
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC* InputTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC* IndicesTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC* OutputTensor;
  UINT InputDimensionCount;
  UINT IndicesDimensionCount;
  UINT BatchDimensionCount;
};
```

## Members

`InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to read from.

`IndicesTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor containing the indices. The *DimensionCount* of this tensor must match *InputTensor.DimensionCount*. The last dimension of the *IndicesTensor* is actually the number of coordinates per index tuple, and it cannot exceed *InputTensor.DimensionCount*. For example, an indices tensor of *Sizes* `{1,4,5,2}` with *IndicesDimensionCount* = 3 means a 4x5 array of 2-coordinate tuples that index into *InputTensor*.

Starting with `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_3_0`, this operator supports negative index values when using a signed integral type with this tensor. Negative indices are interpreted as being relative to the end of the respective dimension. For example, an index of -1 refers to the last element along that dimension.

`OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to write the results to. The *DimensionCount* and *DataType* of this tensor must match *InputTensor.DimensionCount*. The expected *OutputTensor.Sizes* are the concatenation of the *IndicesTensor.Sizes* leading segments and *InputTensor.Sizes* trailing segment, which yields the following.

```
indexTupleSize = IndicesTensor.Sizes[IndicesTensor.DimensionCount - 1]
OutputTensor.Sizes = {
    1...,
    IndicesTensor.Sizes[(IndicesTensor.DimensionCount - IndicesDimensionCount) .. (IndicesTensor.DimensionCount - 1)],
    InputTensor.Sizes[(InputTensor.DimensionCount - indexTupleSize) .. InputTensor.DimensionCount]
}
```

The dimensions are right-aligned, with leading 1 values prepended if needed to satisfy *OutputTensor.DimensionCount*.

Here's an example.

```
InputTensor.Sizes = {3,4,5,6,7}
InputDimensionCount = 5
IndicesTensor.Sizes = {1,1, 1,2,3}
IndicesDimensionCount = 3 // can be thought of as a {1,2} array of 3-coordinate tuples

// The {1,2} comes from the indices tensor (ignoring last dimension which is the tuple size),
// and the {6,7} comes from input tensor, ignoring the first 3 dimensions
// since the index tuples are 3 elements (from the indices tensor last dimension).
OutputTensor.Sizes = {1, 1,2,6,7}
```

`InputDimensionCount`

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The number of actual input dimensions within the *InputTensor* after ignoring any irrelevant leading ones, ranging `[1, *InputTensor.DimensionCount*]`. For example, given *InputTensor.Sizes* = `{1,1,4,6}` and `InputDimensionCount` = 3, the actual meaningful indices are `{1,4,6}`.

`IndicesDimensionCount`

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The number of actual index dimensions within the *IndicesTensor* after ignoring any irrelevant leading ones, ranging [1, *IndicesTensor.DimensionCount*]. For example, given *IndicesTensor.Sizes* = `{1,1,4,6}`, and *IndicesDimensionCount* = 3, the actual meaningful indices are `{1,4,6}`.

`BatchDimensionCount`

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The number of dimensions within each tensor (*InputTensor*, *IndicesTensor*, *OutputTensor*) that are considered independent batches, ranging within both [0, *InputTensor.DimensionCount*) and [0, *IndicesTensor.DimensionCount*). The batch count can be 0, implying a single batch. For example, given *IndicesTensor.Sizes* = `{1,3,4,5,6,7}`, and *IndicesDimensionCount* = 5 and `BatchDimensionCount` = 2, there are batches `{3,4}` and meaningful indices `{5,6,7}`.

## Remarks
**DML_GATHER_ND1_OPERATOR_DESC** adds *BatchDimensionCount*, and is equivalent to [DML_GATHER_ND_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_gather_nd_operator_desc) when *BatchDimensionCount* = 0.

## Examples

### Example 1. 1D remapping

```
InputDimensionCount: 2
IndicesDimensionCount: 2
BatchDimensionCount: 0

InputTensor: (Sizes:{2,2}, DataType:FLOAT32)
    [[0,1],[2,3]]

IndicesTensor: (Sizes:{2,1}, DataType:UINT32)
    [[1],[0]]

// output[y, x] = input[indices[y], x]
OutputTensor: (Sizes:{2,2}, DataType:FLOAT32)
    [[2,3],[0,1]]
```

### Example 2. 2D remapping with batch count

```
InputDimensionCount: 3
IndicesDimensionCount: 3
BatchDimensionCount: 1

// 3 batches.
InputTensor: (Sizes:{1, 3,2,2}, DataType:FLOAT32)
    [
        [[[0,1],[2,3]],   // batch 0
         [[4,5],[6,7]],   // batch 1
         [[8,9],[10,11]]] // batch 2
    ]

// A 3x2 array of 2D tuples indexing into InputTensor.
// e.g. a tuple of <1,0> in batch 1 corresponds to input value 6.
IndicesTensor: (Sizes:{1, 3,2,2}, DataType:UINT32)
    [
        [[[0,0],[1,1]],
         [[1,1],[0,0]],
         [[0,1],[1,0]]]
    ]

// output[batch, x] = input[batch, indices[batch, x, 0], indices[batch, x, 1]]
OutputTensor: (Sizes:{1,1, 3,2}, DataType:FLOAT32)
    [[
        [[0,3],
         [7,4],
         [9,10]]
    ]]
```

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_3_0`.

## Tensor constraints
* *IndicesTensor*, *InputTensor*, and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DimensionCount*.
* *InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*.
