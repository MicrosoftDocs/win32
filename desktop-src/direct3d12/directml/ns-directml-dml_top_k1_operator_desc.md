# DML_TOP_K1_OPERATOR_DESC structure (directml.h)
Selects the largest or smallest *K* elements from each sequence along an axis of the *InputTensor*, and returns the values and indices of those elements in the *OutputValueTensor* and *OutputIndexTensor*, respectively. A *sequence* refers to one of the sets of elements that exist along the *Axis* dimension of the *InputTensor*.

The choice of whether to select the largest K elements or the smallest K elements can be controlled using *AxisDirection*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/). Also see [DirectML version history](/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-version-history).

## Syntax
```cpp
struct DML_TOP_K1_OPERATOR_DESC {
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *InputTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *OutputValueTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *OutputIndexTensor;
  UINT                  Axis;
  UINT                  K;
  DML_AXIS_DIRECTION    AxisDirection;
};
```



## Members

`InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The input tensor containing elements to select.


`OutputValueTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the values of the top *K* elements to. The top *K* elements are selected based on whether they are the largest or the smallest, depending on the value of *AxisDirection*. This tensor must have sizes equal to the *InputTensor*, *except* for the dimension specified by the *Axis* parameter, which must have a size equal to *K*.

The *K* values selected from each input sequence are guaranteed to be sorted descending (largest to smallest) if *AxisDirection* is [DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_DECREASING](/windows/win32/direct3d12/directml/ne-directml-dml_axis_direction). Otherwise, the opposite is true and the values selected are guaranteed to be sorted ascending (smallest to largest).


`OutputIndexTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the indices of the top *K* elements to. This tensor must have sizes equal to the *InputTensor*, *except* for the dimension specified by the *Axis* parameter, which must have a size equal to *K*.

The indices returned in this tensor are measured relative to the beginning of their sequence (as opposed to the beginning of the tensor). For example, an index of 0 always refers to the first element for all sequences in an axis.

In cases where two or more elements in the top-K have the same value (that is, when there is a tie), the indices of both elements are included, and are guaranteed to be ordered by ascending element index. Note that this is true irrespective of the value of *AxisDirection*.


`Axis`

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The index of the dimension to select elements across. This value must be less than the *DimensionCount* of the *InputTensor*.


`K`

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The number of elements to select. *K* must be greater than 0, but less than the number of elements in the *InputTensor* along the dimension specified by *Axis*.


`AxisDirection`

Type: **[DML_AXIS_DIRECTION](/windows/win32/direct3d12/directml/ne-directml-dml_axis_direction)**

A value from the [DML_AXIS_DIRECTION](/windows/win32/direct3d12/directml/ne-directml-dml_axis_direction) enumeration. If set to **DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_INCREASING**, then this operator returns the *smallest* *K* elements in order of increasing value. Otherwise, it returns the *largest* *K* elements in decreasing order.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
InputTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,4}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[[[ 0,  1, 10, 11],
   [ 3,  2,  9,  8],
   [ 4,  5,  6,  7]]]]

Axis: 3
K:    2
AxisDirection: DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_DECREASING
   
OutputValueTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,2}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[[[11, 10],
   [ 9,  8],
   [ 7,  6]]]]

OutputIndexTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,2}, DataType:UINT32)
[[[[3, 2],
   [2, 3],
   [3, 2]]]]
```

### Example 2. Using a different axis

```
InputTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,4}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[[[ 0,  1, 10, 11],
   [ 3,  2,  9,  8],
   [ 4,  5,  6,  7]]]]

Axis: 2
K:    2
AxisDirection: DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_DECREASING
   
OutputValueTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,2,4}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[[[ 4,  5, 10, 11],
   [ 3,  2,  9,  8]]]]

OutputIndexTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,2,4}, DataType:UINT32)
[[[[2, 2, 0, 0],
   [1, 1, 1, 1]]]]
```

### Example 3. Tied values

```
InputTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,4}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[[[1, 2, 2, 3],
   [3, 4, 5, 5],
   [6, 6, 6, 6]]]]

Axis: 3
K:    3
AxisDirection: DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_DECREASING
   
OutputValueTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,3}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[[[3, 2, 2],
   [5, 5, 4],
   [6, 6, 6]]]]

OutputIndexTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,3}, DataType:UINT32)
[[[[3, 1, 2],
   [2, 3, 1],
   [0, 1, 2]]]]
```

### Example 4. Increasing axis direction

```
InputTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,4}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[[[1, 2, 2, 3],
   [3, 4, 5, 5],
   [6, 6, 6, 6]]]]

Axis: 3
K:    3
AxisDirection: DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_INCREASING
   
OutputValueTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,3}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[[[1, 2, 2],
   [3, 4, 5],
   [6, 6, 6]]]]

OutputIndexTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,3}, DataType:UINT32)
[[[[0, 1, 2],
   [0, 1, 2],
   [0, 1, 2]]]]
```


## Remarks
When *AxisDirection* is set to [DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_DECREASING](/windows/win32/direct3d12/directml/ne-directml-dml_axis_direction), this operator is equivalent to [DML_TOP_K_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_top_k_operator_desc).

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_1`.

## Tensor constraints
* *InputTensor* and *OutputValueTensor* must have the same *DataType*.
* *OutputIndexTensor* and *OutputValueTensor* must have the same *Sizes*.

## Tensor support
