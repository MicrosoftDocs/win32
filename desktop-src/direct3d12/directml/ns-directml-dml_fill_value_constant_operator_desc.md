# DML_FILL_VALUE_CONSTANT_OPERATOR_DESC structure (directml.h)

Fills a tensor with the given constant *Value*. This operator performs the following pseudocode.

```
for each coordinate in OutputTensor
    OutputTensor[coordinate] = Value
endfor
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/). Also see [DirectML version history](/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-version-history).

## Syntax
```cpp
struct DML_FILL_VALUE_CONSTANT_OPERATOR_DESC {
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *OutputTensor;
  DML_TENSOR_DATA_TYPE  ValueDataType;
  DML_SCALAR_UNION      Value;
};
```



## Members

`OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to write the results to. This tensor may have any size.


`ValueDataType`

Type: **[DML_TENSOR_DATA_TYPE](/windows/win32/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_tensor_data_type)**

The data type of the *Value* field, which must match *OutputTensor.DataType*.


`Value`

Type: **[DML_SCALAR_UNION](/windows/win32/direct3d12/directml/ns-directml-dml_scalar_union)**

A constant value to fill the output, with *ValueDataType* determining how to interpret the field.

## Examples

```
Value = 13.0

OutputTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,2,4}, DataType:FLOAT32)
    [[[[13.0f, 13.0f, 13.0f, 13.0f],
       [13.0f, 13.0f, 13.0f, 13.0f]]]]
```

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_1`.

## Tensor support
| Tensor | Kind | Supported dimension counts | Supported data types |
| ------ | ---- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| OutputTensor | Output | 4 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16, INT32, INT16, INT8, UINT32, UINT16, UINT8 |
