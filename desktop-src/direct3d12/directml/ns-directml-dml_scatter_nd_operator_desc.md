# DML_SCATTER_ND_OPERATOR_DESC structure (directml.h)
Copies the whole input tensor to the output, then overwrites selected indices with corresponding values from the updates tensor. This operator performs the following pseudocode, where "..." represents a series of coordinates, with the exact behavior determined by the axis and indices size.

```
output = input
output[indices[...]] = updates[...]
```

If two output element indices overlap (which is invalid), there is no guarantee of which last write wins.

## Syntax
```cpp
struct DML_SCATTER_ND_OPERATOR_DESC {
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *InputTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *IndicesTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *UpdatesTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *OutputTensor;
  UINT                  InputDimensionCount;
  UINT                  IndicesDimensionCount;
};
```



## Members

`InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to read from.


`IndicesTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A tensor containing the indices. The *DimensionCount* of this tensor must match *InputTensor.DimensionCount*. The last dimension of the *IndicesTensor* is actually the number of coordinates per index tuple, and it mustn't exceed *InputTensor.DimensionCount*. For example, an indices tensor of size `{1,4,5,2}` with *IndicesDimensionCount* = 3 means a 4x5 array of 2-value coordinate tuples that index into *InputTensor*.

Starting with `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_3_0`, this operator supports negative index values when using a signed integral type with this tensor. Negative indices are interpreted as being relative to the end of the respective dimension. For example, an index of -1 refers to the last element along that dimension.


`UpdatesTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A tensor containing the new values to replace the existing input values at the corresponding indices. The *DimensionCount* of this tensor must match *InputTensor.DimensionCount*. The expected *UpdatesTensor.Sizes* are the concatenation of the *IndicesTensor.Sizes* leading segments and *InputTensor.Sizes* trailing segment to yield the following.

```
indexTupleSize = IndicesTensor.Sizes[IndicesTensor.DimensionCount - 1]
UpdatesTensor.Sizes = [
    1...,
    IndicesTensor.Sizes[(IndicesTensor.DimensionCount - IndicesDimensionCount) .. (IndicesTensor.DimensionCount - 1)],
    InputTensor.Sizes[(InputTensor.DimensionCount - indexTupleSize) .. InputTensor.DimensionCount]
]
```

The dimensions are right-aligned, with leading 1 values prepended if needed to satisfy *UpdatesTensor.DimensionCount*.

Here's an example.

```
InputTensor.Sizes = [3,4,5,6,7]
InputDimensionCount = 5
IndicesTensor.Sizes = [1,1, 1,2,3]
IndicesDimensionCount = 3 // can be thought of as a [1,2] array of 3-coordinate tuples

// The [1,2] comes from the indices tensor (ignoring last dimension, which is the tuple size),
// and the [6,7] comes from input tensor, ignoring the first 3 dimensions
// since the index tuples are 3 elements (from the indices tensor last dimension).
UpdatesTensor.Sizes = [1, 1,2,6,7]
```


`OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to write the results to. The *Sizes* and *DataType* of this tensor must match *InputTensor.Sizes*.


`InputDimensionCount`

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The number of actual input dimensions within the *InputTensor* after ignoring any irrelevant leading ones, ranging [1, *InputTensor.DimensionCount*). For example, given *InputTensor.Sizes* = {1,1,4,6} and *InputDimensionCount* = 3, the actual meaningful indices are {1,4,6}.


`IndicesDimensionCount`

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The number of actual index dimensions within the *IndicesTensor* after ignoring any irrelevant leading ones, ranging [1, *IndicesTensor.DimensionCount*). For example, given *IndicesTensor.Sizes* = {1,1,4,6} and *IndicesDimensionCount* = 3, the actual meaningful indices are {1,4,6}.

## Examples

```
InputTensor: (Sizes:{8}, DataType:FLOAT32)
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

IndicesTensor: (Sizes:{4,1}, DataType:FLOAT32)
    [[4], [3], [1], [7]]

UpdatesTensor: (Sizes:{4}, DataType:FLOAT32)
    [9, 10, 11, 12]

// output = input
// output[indices[x, 0]] = updates[x]
OutputTensor: (Sizes:{8}, DataType:FLOAT32)
    [1, 11, 3, 10, 9, 6, 7, 12]
```

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_1`.

## Tensor constraints
* *IndicesTensor*, *InputTensor*, *OutputTensor*, and `UpdatesTensor` must have the same *DimensionCount*.
* *InputTensor*, *OutputTensor*, and `UpdatesTensor` must have the same *DataType*.
