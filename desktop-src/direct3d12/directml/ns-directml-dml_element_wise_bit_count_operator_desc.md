# DML_ELEMENT_WISE_BIT_NOT_OPERATOR_DESC structure (directml.h)

Computes the bitwise NOT for each element of the input tensor, and writes the result into the output tensor.

The input and output tensor must have the same *DimensionCount*, *Sizes*, and *DataType*.

This operator supports in-place execution, meaning that the output tensor is permitted to alias the input tensor during binding.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/) version 1.4 and later. Also see [DirectML version history](../dml-version-history.md).

## Syntax

```cpp
struct DML_ELEMENT_WISE_BIT_NOT_OPERATOR_DESC
{
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC* InputTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC* OutputTensor;
};
```

## Members

`InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The input tensor to read from.

`OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the results to.

## Example

```
InputTensor: (Sizes:{2,2}, DataType:UINT8)
[[0,  128], // 0b00000000, 0b10000000
 [42, 255]] // 0b00101010, 0b11111111

OutputTensor: (Sizes:{2,2}, DataType:UINT8)
[[255, 127], // 0b11111111, 0b01111111
 [213, 0  ]] // 0b11010101, 0b00000000
```

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_3_0`.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*, *DimensionCount*, and *Sizes*.

## Tensor support
| Tensor | Kind | Supported dimension counts | Supported data types |
| ------ | ---- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| InputTensor | Input | 1 to 8 | UINT32, UINT16, UINT8 |
| OutputTensor | Output | 1 to 8 | UINT32, UINT16, UINT8 |
