# DML_ACTIVATION_CELU_OPERATOR_DESC structure (directml.h)

Performs the continuously differentiable exponential linear unit (CELU) activation function on every element in *InputTensor*, placing the result into the corresponding element of *OutputTensor*.

```
f(x) = max(0, x) + min(0, Alpha * (exp(x / Alpha) - 1));
```

Where:
* exp(x) is the natural exponentiation function
* max(a,b) returns the larger of the two values a,b
* min(a,b) returns the smaller of the two values a,b

This operator supports in-place execution, meaning that the output tensor is permitted to alias *InputTensor* during binding.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/). Also see [DirectML version history](/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-version-history).

## Syntax
```cpp
struct DML_ACTIVATION_CELU_OPERATOR_DESC
{
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC* InputTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC* OutputTensor;
  FLOAT Alpha;
};
```

## Members

`InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The input tensor to read from.

`OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the results to.

`Alpha`

Type: <b><a href="/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types">FLOAT</a></b>

The alpha coefficient. A typical default for this value is 1.0.

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_3_0`.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*, *DimensionCount*, and *Sizes*.

## Tensor support
| Tensor | Kind | Supported Dimension Counts | Supported Data Types |
| ------ | ---- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| InputTensor | Input | 1 to 8 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16 |
| OutputTensor | Output | 1 to 8 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16 |
