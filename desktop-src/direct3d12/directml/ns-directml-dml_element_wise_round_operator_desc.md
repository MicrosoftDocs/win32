# DML_ELEMENT_WISE_ROUND_OPERATOR_DESC structure (directml.h)

Rounds each element of *InputTensor* to an integer value, placing the result into the corresponding element of *OutputTensor*.

This operator supports in-place execution, meaning that *OutputTensor* is permitted to alias *InputTensor* during binding.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/). Also see [DirectML version history](/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-version-history).

## Syntax
```cpp
struct DML_ELEMENT_WISE_ROUND_OPERATOR_DESC {
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *InputTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *OutputTensor;
  DML_ROUNDING_MODE     RoundingMode;
};
```



## Members

`InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The input tensor to read from.


`OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the results to.


`RoundingMode`

Type: **[DML_ROUNDING_MODE](/windows/win32/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_rounding_mode)**

A [DML_ROUNDING_MODE](/windows/win32/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_rounding_mode) determining the direction to round towards.

* If **DML_ROUNDING_MODE_HALVES_TO_NEAREST_EVEN**: values are rounded to the nearest integer, with halfway values (for example, 0.5) being rounded toward the nearest even integer.
* If **DML_ROUNDING_MODE_TOWARD_ZERO**: values are rounded toward zero. This effectively truncates the fractional part.
* If **DML_ROUNDING_MODE_TOWARD_INFINITY**: values are rounded to the nearest integer, with halfway values (for example, 0.5) being rounded away from zero (toward positive or negative infinity, depending on the sign of the value).

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_1`.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*, *DimensionCount*, and *Sizes*.

## Tensor support
### DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_3_0 and above
| Tensor | Kind | Supported dimension counts | Supported data types |
| ------ | ---- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| InputTensor | Input | 1 to 8 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16 |
| OutputTensor | Output | 1 to 8 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16 |

### DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_1 and above
| Tensor | Kind | Supported dimension counts | Supported data types |
| ------ | ---- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| InputTensor | Input | 4 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16 |
| OutputTensor | Output | 4 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16 |
