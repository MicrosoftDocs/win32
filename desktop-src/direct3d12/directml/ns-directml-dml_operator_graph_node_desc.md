# DML_OPERATOR_GRAPH_NODE_DESC structure (directml.h)
Decribes a node within a graph of DirectML operators defined by [DML_GRAPH_DESC](/windows/desktop/direct3d12/directml/ns-directml-dml_graph_desc) and passed to [IDMLDevice1::CompileGraph](/windows/desktop/direct3d12/directml/nf-directml-idmldevice1-compilegraph).

The behavior of this node is defined by a DirectML operator.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/). Also see [DirectML version history](/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-version-history).

## Syntax
```cpp
struct DML_OPERATOR_GRAPH_NODE_DESC {
  IDMLOperator *Operator;
  const char   *Name;
};
```



## Members

`Operator`

Type: <b>[IDMLOperator](/windows/win32/api/directml/nn-directml-idmloperator)*</b>

A DirectML operator defining the behavior of the node.


`Name`

Type: \_Field\_z\_ \_Maybenull\_ **const char\***

An optional name for the graph connection. If provided, this might be used within certain error messages emitted by the DirectML debug layer.

## Availability

This API was introduced in DirectML version `1.1.0`.
