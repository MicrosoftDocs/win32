# DML_SLICE1_OPERATOR_DESC structure (directml.h)
Extracts a single subregion (a "slice") of an input tensor.

The *input window* describes the bounds of the input tensor to consider in the slice. The window is defined using three values for each dimension.

- The *offset* marks the *beginning of the window* in a dimension.
- The *size* marks the extent of the window in a dimension. The *end of the window* in a dimension is `offset + size - 1`.
- The *stride* indicates how to traverse the elements in a dimension.
  - The magnitude of the stride indicates how many elements to advance when copying within the window.
  - If a stride is positive, elements are copied starting at the *beginning* of the window in the dimension.
  - If a stride is negative, elements are copied starting at the *end* of the window in the dimension.

The following pseudo-code illustrates how elements are copied using the input window. Note how elements in a dimension are copied from start to end with a positive stride, and copied from end to start with a negative stride.

```
CopyStart = InputWindowOffsets
for dimension i in [0, DimensionCount - 1]:
    if InputWindowStrides[i] < 0:
        CopyStart[i] += InputWindowSizes[i] - 1 // start at the end of the window in this dimension

OutputTensor[OutputCoordinates] = InputTensor[CopyStart + InputWindowStrides * OutputCoordinates]
```

The input window mustn't be empty in any dimension, and the window mustn't extend beyond the dimensions of the input tensor (out-of-bounds reads aren't permitted). The window's size and strides effectively limit the number of elements that may be copied from each dimension `i` of the input tensor.

```
MaxCopiedElements[i] = 1 + (InputWindowSize[i] - 1) / InputWindowStrides[i]
```

The output tensor isn't required to copy all reachable elements within the window. The slice is valid so long as `1 <= OutputSizes[i] <= MaxCopiedElements[i]`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/). Also see [DirectML version history](/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-version-history).

## Syntax
```cpp
struct DML_SLICE1_OPERATOR_DESC {
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *InputTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *OutputTensor;
  UINT                  DimensionCount;
  const UINT            *InputWindowOffsets;
  const UINT            *InputWindowSizes;
  const INT             *InputWindowStrides;
};
```



## Members

`InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to extract slices from.


`OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to write the sliced data results to.


`DimensionCount`

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The number of dimensions. This field determines the size of the *InputWindowOffsets*, *InputWindowSizes*, and *InputWindowStrides* arrays. This value must match the *DimensionCount* of the input and output tensors. This value must be between 1 and 8, inclusively, starting from `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_3_0`; earlier feature levels require a value of either 4 or 5.


`InputWindowOffsets`

Type: \_Field\_size\_(DimensionCount) <b>const [UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)*</b>

An array containing the beginning (in elements) of the input window in each dimension. Values in the array must satisfy the constraint `InputWindowOffsets[i] + InputWindowSizes[i] <= InputTensor.Sizes[i]`


`InputWindowSizes`

Type: \_Field\_size\_(DimensionCount) <b>const [UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)*</b>

An array containing the extent (in elements) of the input window in each dimension. Values in the array must satisfy the constraint `InputWindowOffsets[i] + InputWindowSizes[i] <= InputTensor.Sizes[i]`


`InputWindowStrides`

Type: \_Field\_size\_(DimensionCount) <b>const [UINT](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)*</b>

An array containing the slice's stride along each dimension of the input tensor, in elements. The magnitude of the stride indicates how many elements to advance when copying within the input window. The sign of the stride determines if elements are copied starting at the beginning of the window (positive stride) or end of the window (negative stride). Strides may not be 0.

## Examples

The following examples use this same input tensor.

```
InputTensor: (Sizes:{1, 1, 4, 4}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[[[ 1,  2,  3,  4],
   [ 5,  6,  7,  8],
   [ 9, 10, 11, 12],
   [13, 14, 15, 16]]]]
```

### Example 1. Strided slice with positive strides

```
InputWindowOffsets = {0, 0, 0, 1}
InputWindowSizes   = {1, 1, 4, 3}
InputWindowStrides = {1, 1, 2, 2}

OutputTensor: (Sizes:{1, 1, 2, 2}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[[[ 2,  4],
   [10, 12]]]]
```

The copied elements are calculated as follows. 
```
Output[0,0,0,0] = {0,0,0,1} + {1,1,2,2} * {0,0,0,0} = Input[{0,0,0,1}] = 2
Output[0,0,0,1] = {0,0,0,1} + {1,1,2,2} * {0,0,0,1} = Input[{0,0,0,3}] = 4
Output[0,0,1,0] = {0,0,0,1} + {1,1,2,2} * {0,0,1,0} = Input[{0,0,2,1}] = 10
Output[0,0,1,1] = {0,0,0,1} + {1,1,2,2} * {0,0,1,1} = Input[{0,0,2,3}] = 12
```

### Example 2. Strided slice with negative strides

```
InputWindowOffsets = {0, 0, 0, 1}
InputWindowSizes   = {1, 1, 4, 3}
InputWindowStrides = {1, 1, -2, 2}

OutputTensor: (Sizes:{1, 1, 2, 2}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[[[14, 16],
   [ 6,  8]]]]
```

Recall that dimensions with negative window strides start copying at the end of the input window for that dimension; this is done by adding `InputWindowSize[i] - 1` to the window offset. Dimensions with a positive stride simply start at `InputWindowOffset[i]`.
- Axis 0 (`+1` window stride) starts copying at `InputWindowOffsets[0] = 0`. 
- Axis 1 (`+1` window stride) starts copying at `InputWindowOffsets[1] = 0`. 
- Axis 2 (`-2` window stride) starts copying at `InputWindowOffsets[2] + InputWindowSizes[0] - 1 = 0 + 4 - 1 = 3`. 
- Axis 3 (`+2` window stride) starts copying at `InputWindowOffsets[3] = 1`. 

The copied elements are calculated as follows. 
```
Output[0,0,0,0] = {0,0,3,1} + {1,1,-2,2} * {0,0,0,0} = Input[{0,0,3,1}] = 14
Output[0,0,0,1] = {0,0,3,1} + {1,1,-2,2} * {0,0,0,1} = Input[{0,0,3,3}] = 16
Output[0,0,1,0] = {0,0,3,1} + {1,1,-2,2} * {0,0,1,0} = Input[{0,0,1,1}] = 6
Output[0,0,1,1] = {0,0,3,1} + {1,1,-2,2} * {0,0,1,1} = Input[{0,0,1,3}] = 8
```


## Remarks
This operator is similar to [DML_SLICE_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_slice_operator_desc), but it differs in two important ways.

- Slice strides may be negative, which allows reversing values along dimensions.
- The input window sizes are not necessarily the same as the output tensor sizes.

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_1`.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType* and *DimensionCount*.
