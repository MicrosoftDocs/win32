# DML_DEPTH_SPACE_ORDER enumeration (directml.h)

Defines constants controlling the transform applied in the DirectML operators [DML_OPERATOR_DEPTH_TO_SPACE1](/windows/win32/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_operator_type) and **DML_OPERATOR_SPACE_TO_DEPTH1**. These are used within the [DML_DEPTH_TO_SPACE1_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/direct3d12/directml/ns-directml-dml_depth_to_space1_operator_desc) and [DML_SPACE_TO_DEPTH1_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/direct3d12/directml/ns-directml-dml_space_to_depth1_operator_desc) structures.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/). Also see [DirectML version history](/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-version-history).

## Syntax
```cpp
typedef enum DML_DEPTH_SPACE_ORDER {
  DML_DEPTH_SPACE_ORDER_DEPTH_COLUMN_ROW,
  DML_DEPTH_SPACE_ORDER_COLUMN_ROW_DEPTH
} ;
```

## Constants

| Name | Description |
| ---- |:---- |
| DML_DEPTH_SPACE_ORDER_DEPTH_COLUMN_ROW | Causes tensors used in [DML_DEPTH_TO_SPACE1_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/direct3d12/directml/ns-directml-dml_depth_to_space1_operator_desc) and [DML_SPACE_TO_DEPTH1_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/direct3d12/directml/ns-directml-dml_space_to_depth1_operator_desc) to be interpreted with the following layouts, where dimensions in parenthesis are flattened together.<br><br>- **Depth version**: [Batch, (BlockHeight, BlockWidth, Channels), Height, Width]<br>- **Space version**: [Batch, Channels, (Height, BlockHeight), (Width, BlockWidth)] |
| DML_DEPTH_SPACE_ORDER_COLUMN_ROW_DEPTH | Causes tensors used in [DML_DEPTH_TO_SPACE1_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/direct3d12/directml/ns-directml-dml_depth_to_space1_operator_desc) and [DML_SPACE_TO_DEPTH1_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/direct3d12/directml/ns-directml-dml_space_to_depth1_operator_desc) to be interpreted with the following layouts, where dimensions in parenthesis are flattened together.<br><br>- **Depth version**: [Batch, (Channels, BlockHeight, BlockWidth), Height, Width]<br>- **Space version**: [Batch, Channels, (Height, BlockHeight), (Width, BlockWidth)] |
