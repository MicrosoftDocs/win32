# DML_RESAMPLE1_OPERATOR_DESC structure (directml.h)
Resamples elements from the source to the destination tensor, using the scale factors to compute the destination tensor size. You can use a linear or nearest-neighbor interpolation mode. The operator supports interpolation across multiple dimensions, not just 2D. So you can keep the same spatial size, but interpolate across channels or across batches. The relationship between the input and output coordinates is the following.

`OutputTensorX = (InputTensorX + InputPixelOffset) * Scale + OutputPixelOffset`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/). Also see [DirectML version history](/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-version-history).

## Syntax
```cpp
struct DML_RESAMPLE1_OPERATOR_DESC {
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC  *InputTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC  *OutputTensor;
  DML_INTERPOLATION_MODE InterpolationMode;
  UINT                   DimensionCount;
  const FLOAT            *Scales;
  const FLOAT            *InputPixelOffsets;
  const FLOAT            *OutputPixelOffsets;
};
```



## Members

`InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor containing the input data.


`OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The tensor to write the output data to.


`InterpolationMode`

Type: [**DML_INTERPOLATION_MODE**](/windows/win32/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_interpolation_mode)

This field determines the kind of interpolation used to choose output pixels.

- **DML_INTERPOLATION_MODE_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR**. Uses the *Nearest Neighbor* algorithm, which chooses the input element nearest to the corresponding pixel center for each output element.

- **DML_INTERPOLATION_MODE_LINEAR**. Uses the *Quadrilinear* algorithm, which computes the output element by doing the weighted average of the 2 nearest neighboring input elements per dimension. Since all 4 dimensions can be resampled, the weighted average is computed on a total of 16 input elements for each output element.


`DimensionCount`

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The number of values in the arrays that *Scales*, *InputPixelOffsets*, and *OutputPixelOffsets* point to. This value must match the dimension count of *InputTensor* and *OutputTensor*, which has to be 4.


`Scales`

Type: \_Field\_size\_(DimensionCount) **const [FLOAT](/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)\***

The scales to apply when resampling the input, where scales > 1 scale up the image and scales < 1 scale down the image for that dimension. Note that the scales don't need to be exactly `OutputSize / InputSize`. If the input after scaling is larger than the output bound, then we crop it to the output size. On the other hand, if the input after scaling is smaller than the output bound, the output edges are clamped.


`InputPixelOffsets`

Type: \_Field\_size\_(DimensionCount) **const [FLOAT](/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)\***

The offsets to apply to the input pixels before resampling. When this value is `0`, the top left corner of the pixel is used instead of its center, which usually won't give the expected result. To resample the image by using the center of the pixels and to get the same behavior as [DML_RESAMPLE_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_resample_operator_desc), this value must be `0.5`.


`OutputPixelOffsets`

Type: \_Field\_size\_(DimensionCount) **const [FLOAT](/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)\***

The offsets to apply to the output pixels after resampling. When this value is `0`, the top left corner of the pixel is used instead of its center, which usually won't give the expected result. To resample the image by using the center of the pixels and to get the same behavior as [DML_RESAMPLE_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_resample_operator_desc), this value must be `-0.5`.


## Remarks
When the *InputPixelOffsets* are set to 0.5, and the *OutputPixelOffsets* are set to -0.5, this operator is equivalent to [DML_RESAMPLE_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_resample_operator_desc).

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_1`.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*.
