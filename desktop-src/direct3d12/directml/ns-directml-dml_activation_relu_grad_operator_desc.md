# DML_ACTIVATION_RELU_GRAD_OPERATOR_DESC structure (directml.h)

Computes backpropagation gradients for a rectified linear unit (ReLU). This operator performs the following element-wise computation.

```
X = InputTensor
dY = InputGradientTensor

OutputGradientTensor = (X > 0 ? dY : 0)
```

The corresponding forward-pass operator is [DML_ACTIVATION_RELU_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_activation_relu_operator_desc).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/). Also see [DirectML version history](/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-version-history).

## Syntax
```cpp
struct DML_ACTIVATION_RELU_GRAD_OPERATOR_DESC
{
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC* InputTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC* InputGradientTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC* OutputGradientTensor;
};
```

## Members

`InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The input (feature) tensor. This is typically the same input as was provided during the forward pass (see [DML_ACTIVATION_RELU_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_activation_relu_operator_desc)).

`InputGradientTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The incoming gradient tensor. This is typically obtained from the output of backpropagation of a preceding layer. The *Sizes* and *DataType* of this tensor must exactly match those of the *InputTensor*.

`OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

An output tensor containing the backpropagated gradients. The *Sizes* and *DataType* of this tensor must exactly match those of the *InputTensor*.

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_3_0`.

## Tensor constraints
*InputGradientTensor*, *InputTensor*, and *OutputGradientTensor* must have the same *DataType*, *DimensionCount*, and *Sizes*.

## Tensor support
| Tensor | Kind | Supported dimension counts | Supported data types |
| ------ | ---- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| InputTensor | Input | 1 to 8 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16 |
| InputGradientTensor | Input | 1 to 8 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16 |
| OutputGradientTensor | Output | 1 to 8 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16 |
