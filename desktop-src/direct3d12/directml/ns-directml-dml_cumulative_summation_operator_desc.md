# DML_CUMULATIVE_SUMMATION_OPERATOR_DESC structure (directml.h)

Sums the elements of a tensor along an axis, writing the running tally of the summation into the output tensor.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/). Also see [DirectML version history](/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-version-history).

## Syntax
```cpp
struct DML_CUMULATIVE_SUMMATION_OPERATOR_DESC {
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *InputTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *OutputTensor;
  UINT                  Axis;
  DML_AXIS_DIRECTION    AxisDirection;
  BOOL                  HasExclusiveSum;
};
```



## Members

`InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The input tensor containing elements to be summed.


`OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the resulting cumulative summations to. This tensor must have the same sizes and data type as the *InputTensor*.


`Axis`

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The index of the dimension to sum elements over. This value must be less than the *DimensionCount* of the *InputTensor*.


`AxisDirection`

Type: **[DML_AXIS_DIRECTION](/windows/win32/direct3d12/directml/ne-directml-dml_axis_direction)**

One of the values of the [DML_AXIS_DIRECTION](/windows/win32/direct3d12/directml/ne-directml-dml_axis_direction) enumeration. If set to **DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_INCREASING**, then the summation occurs by traversing the tensor along the specified axis by ascending element index. If set to **DML_AXIS_DIRECTION_DECREASING**, the reverse is true, and the summation occurs by traversing elements by descending index.


`HasExclusiveSum`




## Remarks
This operator supports in-place execution, meaning that the *OutputTensor* is permitted to alias the *InputTensor* during binding.

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_1`.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType* and *Sizes*.

## Tensor support
| Tensor | Kind | Supported dimension counts | Supported data types |
