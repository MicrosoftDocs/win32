# DML_REVERSE_SUBSEQUENCES_OPERATOR_DESC structure (directml.h)
Reverses the elements of one or more *subsequences* of a tensor. The set of subsequences to be reversed is chosen based on the provided axis and sequence lengths.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/). Also see [DirectML version history](/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-version-history).

## Syntax
```cpp
struct DML_REVERSE_SUBSEQUENCES_OPERATOR_DESC {
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *InputTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *SequenceLengthsTensor;
  const DML_TENSOR_DESC *OutputTensor;
  UINT                  Axis;
};
```



## Members

`InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The input tensor containing elements to be reversed.


`SequenceLengthsTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A tensor containing a value for each subsequence to be reversed, denoting the length in elements of that subsequence. Only the elements within the length of the subsequence are reversed; the remaining elements along that axis are copied to the output unchanged.

This tensor must have dimension count and sizes equal to the *InputTensor*, *except* for the dimension specified by the *Axis* parameter. The size of the *Axis* dimension must be 1. For example if the *InputTensor* has sizes of `{2,3,4,5}`, and *Axis* is 1, then the sizes of the *SequenceLengthsTensor* must be `{2,1,4,5}`.

If the length of a subsequence exceeds the maximum number of elements along that axis, then this operator behaves as if the value were clamped to the maximum.


`OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the results to. This tensor must have the same sizes and data type as the *InputTensor*.


`Axis`

Type: [**UINT**](/windows/desktop/winprog/windows-data-types)

The index of the dimension to reverse elements over. This value must be less than the DimensionCount of the *InputTensor*.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
InputTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,4}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[[[1,  2,  3,  4],
   [5,  6,  7,  8],
   [9, 10, 11, 12]]]]
   
SequenceTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,1}, DataType:UINT32)
[[[[2],
   [4],
   [3]]]]

Axis: 3

OutputTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,4}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[[[ 2,  1,  3,  4],
   [ 8,  7,  6,  5],
   [11, 10,  9, 12]]]]
```

### Example 2. Reversing along a different axis

```
InputTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,4}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[[[1,  2,  3,  4],
   [5,  6,  7,  8],
   [9, 10, 11, 12]]]]
   
SequenceTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,1,4}, DataType:UINT32)
[[[[2, 3, 1, 0]]]]

Axis: 2

OutputTensor: (Sizes:{1,1,3,4}, DataType:FLOAT32)
[[[[5, 10,  3,  4], // Notice that sequence lengths of 1 and 0 are effective nops
   [1,  6,  7,  8],
   [9,  2, 11, 12]]]]
```

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_1`.

## Tensor constraints
* *InputTensor*, *OutputTensor*, and *SequenceLengthsTensor* must have the same *DimensionCount*.
* *InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*.
