# Understanding Direct3D 12

To write 3D games and apps for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile, you must understand the basics of the Direct3D 12 technology, and how to prepare to use it in your games and apps.

Use the topics in this section to set up and learn about the environment in which you will program your apps and games with Direct3D 12. This content will also help you to port your Direct3D 11 apps and games to Direct3D 12, so you can take advantage of Direct3D 12 features and efficiencies.

To program with Direct3D 12, you need these components:

-   A hardware platform with a Direct3D 12-compatible GPU
-   [Display drivers](/previous-versions//ff569172(v=vs.85)) that support the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) 2.0
