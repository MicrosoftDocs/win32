# About the Device Host API

The Device Host API with UPnP technology is a framework for implementing UPnP-based device functionality on the Windows platform. Developers who are creating devices by using the Device Host API with UPnP technology (referred to as [*hosted devices*](h-gly.md)) need only implement the device's core functionality. Developers can rely on the device host to handle the UPnP-specific details of discovery, description, control, eventing, and presentation. The device host validates incoming data from UPnP-based clients and formats all outgoing data from hosted devices according to the UPnP device architecture.

The following sections explain, in general, how the UPnP device host works:

-   [Implementing a Hosted Device](implementing-a-hosted-device.md)
-   [Registering a Hosted Device with the Device Host](registering-a-hosted-device-with-the-device-host.md)
-   [Device Providers](device-providers.md)
-   [Eventing](eventing.md)
-   [Presentation](presentation.md)
