</dt> <dd>

A device provider is an entity that is registered with the device host. This device provider is not published on the network. However, the device provider registers other devices and publishes them on the network.

A standard device type is denoted by urn:schemas-upnp-org:device: followed by a unique name assigned by the UPnP Forum.

There is a one-to-one relationship between UPnP-based device templates and device types. UPnP vendors might specify additional device types; these are denoted by urn:domain-name:device: followed by a unique name assigned by the vendor, where domain-name is a domain name registered to the vendor.
