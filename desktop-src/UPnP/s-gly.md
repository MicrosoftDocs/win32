A service type is a URN that identifies a service. There is a one-to-one relationship between a UPnP service template and a service type. Several standard service types are defined by the UPnP Forum working committees. The service types are in the form urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:serviceType:version. For example, a scanner service type could be urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:scanner:1.

UPnP vendors may specify additional services. Such services are denoted by urn:domain-name:service:serviceType:version where domain-name is a domain name that is registered to the vendor.
