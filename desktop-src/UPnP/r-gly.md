A root device is the top-most device in a device tree. For example, if you are accessing a VCR/TV combination device called a viewing station, there are three devices: the viewing station, the VCR, and the TV. The viewing station is considered the root device.

A running device is a device that has already had its code loaded prior to registration.

These are devices for which a service description is not known prior to registration.

Examples of such devices are bridges, such as a UPnP SCP bridge. This bridge registers running devices with the device host.
