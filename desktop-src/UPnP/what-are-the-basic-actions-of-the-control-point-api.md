# What are the Basic Actions of the Control Point API?

All control points perform the following tasks:

-   Find available UPnP-based devices on the network.
-   Determine which of these devices are of interest.
-   Issue control requests to the devices of interest and receive events generated by the devices.

An application must first find available UPnP-based devices on the network by performing a search. Because the search criteria defined by the UPnP architecture are fairly broad, the application might find more devices than are needed. Therefore, the application must examine the characteristics of the devices that were found to determine which ones most closely match the search criteria. The application can then issue control requests to those devices.

The following sections describe how to carry out these operations by using the Control Point API with UPnP technology:

-   [Finding Devices](finding-devices.md)
-   [Describing Devices](describing-devices.md)
-   [Controlling Devices](controlling-devices.md)

For detailed documentation about each interface in the Control Point API, see [Control Point API Reference](control-point-api-with-upnp-technology-reference.md).
