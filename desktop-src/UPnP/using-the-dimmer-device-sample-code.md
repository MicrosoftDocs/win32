# Using the Dimmer Device Sample Code

The Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) includes dimmer device sample code. This sample code demonstrates a simple UPnP-based device implemented by using the Device Host API with UPnP technology.

The DCO\_DimmerService directory contains the implementation for the device .dll. The RegisterDevice directory contains the implementation for registering the device .dll with the UPnP registrar service on the computer. The StepByStep directory contains VC6.0 projects that correspond to the "Step By Step Guide" contained in the Readme.txt file. The "Step By Step Guide" is for developers who do not have prior ATL/COM experience.
