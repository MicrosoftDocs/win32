# About the Control Point API

UPnP technology enables dynamic networking of intelligent appliances, PCs, and other control points. The dynamic networking is available over a variety of physical media. The Microsoft implementation of the Control Point API with UPnP technology consists of a set of COM objects that are used to write applications and Web pages that find and control UPnP-based devices. For example, a UPnP-capable VCR can be controlled from a Web page that was specifically designed to control it. To extend this concept, developers can to control many appliances from a central, remote, or peer location.

Applications created with the Control Point API with UPnP technology range from scripts embedded in HTML pages to full-fledged C++ programs. The Control Point API with UPnP technology supports Microsoft Visual Basic development system, Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), and C++.

The following sections explain, in general, how the Control Point API with UPnP technology works:

-   [Control Point Basics](control-point-basics.md)
-   [Finding Devices](finding-devices.md)
-   [Describing Devices](describing-devices.md)
-   [Controlling Devices](controlling-devices.md)

All the samples throughout the Control Point API with UPnP technology documentation refer to fictitious devices, device types, and strings.
