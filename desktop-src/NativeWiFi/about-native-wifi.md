# About Native Wifi

The Native Wifi application programming interface (API) functions have two purposes: to manage wireless network profiles and to manage wireless network connections. The API elements are exposed by the Auto Configuration Module (ACM). The exposed connection and disconnection API elements can be used to override the automatic configuration logic.
