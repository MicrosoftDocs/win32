# OneX Schema

The OneX Schema defines 802.1X configuration elements. All OneX schema elements apply to both wired and wireless profiles. For a list of defined elements, see [OneX Schema Elements](onexschema-elements.md).

The root element of an 802.1X profile is the [**OneX**](onexschema-onex-element.md) element. Each profile will have exactly one root element. The **OneX** element is in the `https://www.microsoft.com/networking/OneX/v1` namespace.

To view sample profiles for wireless networks that include 802.1X configuration elements, see the following profile samples:

-   [Bootstrap Profile Sample](bootstrap-profile-sample.md)
-   [FIPS Profile Sample](fips-profile-sample.md)
-   [Single Sign-On Profile Sample](single-sign-on-profile-sample.md)
-   [WPA-Enterprise with PEAP-MSCHAPv2 Profile Sample](wpa-enterprise-with-peap-mschapv2-profile-sample.md)
-   [WPA-Enterprise with TLS Profile Sample](wpa-enterprise-with-tls-profile-sample.md)
-   [WPA2-Enterprise with PEAP-MSCHAPv2 Profile Sample](wpa2-enterprise-with-peap-mschapv2-profile-sample.md)
-   [WPA2-Enterprise with TLS Profile Sample](wpa2-enterprise-with-tls-profile-sample.md)

To view sample profiles for wired networks that include 802.1X configuration elements, see the following profile samples:
