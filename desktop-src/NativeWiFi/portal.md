# Native Wifi

## Purpose

The Native Wifi automatic configuration component configures, connects to, and disconnects from wireless networks. Native Wifi can store profiles on the networks it interacts with in the form of XML documents.

## Developer audience

The Native Wifi API is designed for C/C++ developers. Programmers should be familiar with wireless networking concepts and terminology.

## Run-time requirements

The Native Wifi component requires clients running Windows Vista, Windows XP with Service Pack 3 (SP3), or Wireless LAN API for Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2).
