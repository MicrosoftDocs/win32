# About the Wireless Ad Hoc API

The Wireless Ad Hoc API exposes interfaces for enumerating and connecting to 802.11 ad hoc networks. These interfaces provide a simplified object-oriented approach to ad hoc network management. Standard enumerators are provided for networks and interfaces. These enumerators can be filtered to enumerate only ad hoc networks created by your application.

> [!Note]  
> Ad hoc mode might not be available in future versions of Windows. Starting with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2, use [Wi-Fi Direct](about-the-wi-fi-direct-api.md) instead.

 

Developers using the Ad Hoc API should be aware that networks and profiles created using the Ad Hoc API can be manipulated using the Native Wifi API without notifying the relevant Ad Hoc API notification listeners.

The Wireless Ad Hoc API is described in detail in the [Wireless Ad Hoc Reference](wireless-ad-hoc-reference.md).

> [!Note]  
> The Wireless Ad Hoc API is only supported on Windows Vista and later versions of the operating system.
