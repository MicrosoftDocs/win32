# Using Native Wifi

This section describes procedures and programming techniques employed with Native Wifi. It includes basic Native Wifi programming techniques, such as [Native Wifi API Sample](native-wifi-api-sample.md), as well as advanced techniques useful for experienced NativeWifi developers.

The following topics are in this section:

-   [Wireless User Interface APIs](wireless-user-interface-apis.md)
-   [Using the Wi-Fi Direct functions](using-the-wi-fi-direct-api.md)
-   [Using Hosted Network and Internet Connection Sharing](using-hosted-network-and-internet-connection-sharing.md)
-   [Native Wifi API Sample](native-wifi-api-sample.md)
-   [Wireless Hosted Network Sample](wireless-hosted-network-sample.md)
-   [Wired Profile Samples](wired-profile-samples.md)
-   [Wireless Profile Samples](wireless-profile-samples.md)

The [Wireless User Interface APIs](wireless-user-interface-apis.md) topic shows some code used to launch wireless network management user interfaces.

The [Using the Wi-Fi Direct functions](using-the-wi-fi-direct-api.md) topic lists of the Wi-Fi Direct functions and discusses how the functions are used.

The [Using Hosted Network and Internet Connection Sharing](using-hosted-network-and-internet-connection-sharing.md) topic discusses how to use the wireless Hosted Network and Internet Connection Sharing (ICS).

The Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) includes two code samples that demonstrate the use of the Native Wifi API. Also, sample profiles are available that demonstrate the use of various Native Wifi profile schemas.

The following topics have more information about the samples:

-   [Native Wifi API Sample](native-wifi-api-sample.md)
-   [Wireless Hosted Network Sample](wireless-hosted-network-sample.md)
-   [Wired Profile Samples](wired-profile-samples.md)
-   [Wireless Profile Samples](wireless-profile-samples.md)
