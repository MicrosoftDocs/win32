# Network.receptionQuality

The **receptionQuality** property retrieves the percentage of packets received in the last 30 seconds.

## Syntax

*player*.*network*.**receptionQuality**

## Possible Values

This property is a read-only **Number** (**long**).

## Remarks

The number of packets received, lost, and recovered during streaming is monitored once every second. **receptionQuality** is the percentage of packets not lost during the last 30 seconds.

Each time playback is stopped and restarted, this property is set to zero. It is not reset if playback is paused.

This property returns valid information only during run time and only if the *Player*.**URL** property is also set.

## Examples

The following JScript example uses *Network*.**receptionQuality** to display the percentage of packets received. The information is displayed in an HTML DIV created with ID = "RQ". The example uses a timer with a 30-second interval to update the display. The **Player** object was created with ID = "Player".


```JScript
<!-- Create an event handler for play state change. -->
<SCRIPT FOR = Player EVENT = PlayStateChange(NewState)>
   var idI; // Variable for the interval id.

   // Test whether content is playing.
   if (3 == NewState){
         // Start the timer. Update the display every 30 seconds.
         idI = window.setInterval("UpdateRQ()", 30000);
   }

      else{
         // Not playing; stop the timer.
         window.clearInterval(idI);
      }
</SCRIPT>

<!-- Put the function to update the display in a separate code block. -->
<SCRIPT>
function UpdateRQ(){
         RQ.innerHTML = "";
         RQ.innerHTML = "Reception quality: " + Player.network.receptionQuality;
         RQ.innerHTML += "%";         
}
</SCRIPT>

```
