# External.libraryLocationType

> [!Note]  
> This topic describes functionality designed for use by online stores. Use of this functionality outside the context of an online store is not supported.

 

The **libraryLocationType** property retrieves a [library location constant](library-location-constants.md) that indicates the type of the current view in Windows Media Player.

``` syntax
window.external.libraryLocationType
      
```

## Possible Values

This property is a read-only **String** that contains one of the library location constants.

## Remarks

This property works in combination with the [External.libraryLocationID](external-librarylocationid.md) property. For example, suppose **libraryLocationType** is equal to CPAlbumID and **libraryLocationID** is equal to 3. That means the current view in Windows Media Player is showing the album that has an ID of 3. For more information about how Windows Media Player characterizes views of online store content, see [Location and Selected Item](location-and-selected-item.md).

## Requirements
