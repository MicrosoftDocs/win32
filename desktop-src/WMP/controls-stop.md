# Controls.stop method

The **stop** method stops playback of the media item.

## Syntax


```JScript
Controls.stop()
```



## Parameters

This method has no parameters.

## Return value

This method does not return a value.

## Remarks

This method causes Windows Media Player to release any system resources it is using, such as the audio device. The current media item, however, is not released.

When the player is stopped, the track rewinds to the beginning. Calling **play** will then begin playback of the clip from the beginning. To halt a play operation without changing the current position, use the **pause** method.

## Examples

The following example creates an HTML BUTTON element that uses **stop** to stop playback. The **Player** object was created with ID = "Player".


```JScript
<INPUT TYPE = "BUTTON"  ID = "STOP"  NAME = "STOP"  VALUE = "Stop"
    onClick = "

        /* Check first to be sure the operation is valid. */
        if (Player.controls.isAvailable('Stop'))

            /* Stop the Player. */
            Player.controls.stop();
">

```
