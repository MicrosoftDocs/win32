# Skin Files

When you see a skin, you are seeing only the surface. Behind the surface are several files that make up the complete skin. Technically speaking, a skin is a group of files, with each file containing a specific kind of information. Here are the types of files you can use to make up a complete skin.



| File type                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Skin Definition File](skin-definition-file.md) | The master file that defines how the other files will be used. This is a text file and has a .wms file name extension.                                                    |
| [Art Files](art-files.md)                       | Art files that contain the graphic elements of your skin. These include bitmap, GIF, JPEG, and PNG files.                                                                 |
| [JScript Files](jscript-files.md)               | If you want to create more complicated responses to events, you can create script files using Microsoft JScript. These are text files and have a .js file name extension. |
