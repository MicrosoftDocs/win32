# onmousedown

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **onmousedown** event handler handles an event that occurs when the user clicks a mouse button.

``` syntax

## Remarks

This event handler is not applicable to the **PLAYLIST** element, the **VIDEO** element when *VIDEO*.**windowless** is false, or the **EFFECTS** element when *EFFECTS*.**windowed** is true.
