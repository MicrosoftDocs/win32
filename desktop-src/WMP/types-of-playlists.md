# Types of Playlists

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Windows Media metafile playlists, simply referred to as playlists in this document, have .wax, .wvx, or .asx extensions. Playlists with these extensions are used to access Windows Media files with .wma, .wmv, and .asf file name extensions, respectively.
