# Creating a User Interface Plug-in for Windows Media Player 10 Mobile

Windows Media Player 10 Mobile uses the same UI plug-in model as the desktop Windows Media Player. However, Windows Media Player 10 Mobile can only interact with background UI plug-ins. Because of the similar plug-in models, the same API calls that apply to background UI plug-ins on the desktop also apply to background UI plug-ins on a Windows Mobile device.

The following sections describe how to create a background UI plug-in by using wizard-generated code from the Windows Media Player Plug-in Wizard.
