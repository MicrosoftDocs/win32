# Implementing an Audio DSP Plug-in

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

To create a Windows Media Player DSP plug-in that processes audio, you'll need to modify the sample code in the function named **DoProcessOutput**. **DoProcessOutput** is called each time Windows Media Player successfully calls **IMediaObject::ProcessOutput**. It is the function that performs the digital signal processing tasks that produce the audible result that the DSP plug-in is intended to produce.

Processing an audio stream is like handling a timed event. **DoProcessOutput** will be called repeatedly and at specific intervals. Each time your code executes, it will need to process a specific number of bytes of data. **DoProcessOutput** contains the following parameters:



| Parameter          | Description                                                                                                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *pbOutputData*     | This is a **BYTE** pointer to the buffer where your implementation of **DoProcessOutput** must copy its processed data. |
| *pbInputData*      | This is a constant **BYTE** pointer to the buffer that contains the data to be processed.                               |
| *cbBytesToProcess* | This is a **DWORD** value that contains a count of the number of bytes in the input buffer to be processed.             |
