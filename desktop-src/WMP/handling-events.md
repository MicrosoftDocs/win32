# Handling Events

Aside from the XML code that you write to initialize attributes for your skin, the primary code you write is JScript code to handle events. Events are either external or internal; that is, they come from the user or from Windows Media Player.

The following sections provide details about handling events:

-   [External Events](external-events.md)
-   [Internal Events](internal-events.md)
-   [Writing Event Code](writing-event-code.md)
-   [Secondary Events](secondary-events.md)
