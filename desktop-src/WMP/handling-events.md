# Handling Events

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Aside from the XML code that you write to initialize attributes for your skin, the primary code you write is JScript code to handle events. Events are either external or internal; that is, they come from the user or from Windows Media Player.

The following sections provide details about handling events:

-   [External Events](external-events.md)
-   [Internal Events](internal-events.md)
-   [Writing Event Code](writing-event-code.md)
-   [Secondary Events](secondary-events.md)
