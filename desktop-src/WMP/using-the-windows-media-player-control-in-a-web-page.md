# Using the Windows Media Player Control in a Web Page

Embedding the Windows Media Player control in a webpage lets you completely customize the way the user interacts with the control. You can use the interface provided by the control, or you can hide it and display your own user interface. You can specify multiple Windows Media Player control properties at the point where you embed the control, or you can set Player properties and call Player methods in script code.

The following sections describe the basics of embedding the control in a webpage.

> [!Note]  
> The Windows Media Player 10 Mobile control contains functionality based on a subset of the functionality provided in the desktop version of the Windows Media Player control. Therefore, it can be embedded in a Pocket Internet Explorer webpage the same way the desktop control is embedded in an Internet Explorer webpage. To find out whether a particular method, property, or event is supported for the Windows Media Player 10 Mobile control, see [Object Model Reference for Scripting](object-model-reference-for-scripting.md).
