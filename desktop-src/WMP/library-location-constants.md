# Library Location Constants

> [!Note]  
> This section describes functionality designed for use by online stores. Use of this functionality outside the context of an online store is not supported.

 

The library location constants are global string variables defined in contentpartner.h. They are used by certain methods of the [IWMPContentPartner](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/contentpartner/nn-contentpartner-iwmpcontentpartner) and [IWMPContentPartnerCallback](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/contentpartner/nn-contentpartner-iwmpcontentpartnercallback) interfaces and by certain methods of the [External](external-object-for-type-1-online-stores.md) object. These constants are used to indicate the following types.

-   Library location type: This is the type of library view being displayed by Windows Media Player. For example, the Player might be displaying a view of a particular album (g\_szCPAlbumID) or the view of all genres (g\_szAllCPGenreIDs).
-   Selected item type: This is the type of item selected in the library view. For example, the user might select a particular album (g\_szCPAlbumID) in the view of all albums.
-   List type: This is the type of list being requested from the content partner plug-in. For example, Windows Media Player might ask the plug-in to supply a list of items associated with a particular playlist (g\_szCPListID).
-   List item type: The type of individual list item being requested from the content partner plug-in. For example, Windows Media Player might ask the plug-in to supply the list of tracks (g\_szCPTrackID) in a particular playlist.

The following table gives the name and value of each constant, and a brief description of the library location or type. In C or C++ code that is compiled with the contentpartner.h header file, you can use either the name or the value of a constant. Using the name is preferable because the compiler will detect misspellings. In script (for example, when calling the methods of the [External](external-object-for-type-1-online-stores.md) object), you cannot use the name of a constant; you must use the value.



| Name                              | Value                        | Location or type                                                                                                                                                   |

| g\_szUnknownLocation              | UnknownLocation              | A set of tracks that is neither an album nor a playlist. Windows Media Player also uses this constant in the rare event that it cannot determine a valid location. |
