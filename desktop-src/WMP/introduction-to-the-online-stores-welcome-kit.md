# Introduction to the Online Stores Welcome Kit

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The Online Stores Welcome Kit describes the process of bringing an online digital media store on board for Windows Media Player. Windows Media Player supports two kinds of online stores: type 1 and type 2. For information about the difference between type 1 and type 2 stores, see [Windows Media Player Online Stores](windows-media-player-online-stores.md).

The on-boarding process described in the following sections applies to both type 1 and type 2 stores, except for a few differences, which are noted.

## Eligibility

To be eligible to have an online music store integrated with Windows Media Player, your company must meet the on-boarding requirements and maintenance requirements given in the online stores agreement. The types of requirements in the agreement include, but are not limited to, the following.

-   Your company must have the rights to distribute online content via Windows Media Player.
-   Your company must agree to make a certain number of tracks available to users of Windows Media Player.
-   Your company must provide a certain level of uninterrupted service.

Some specific requirements from the agreement are highlighted in [Requirements for Online Music Stores](requirements-for-online-music-stores.md).

## Contacting Microsoft
