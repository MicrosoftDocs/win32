# Introduction to the Online Stores Welcome Kit

The Online Stores Welcome Kit describes the process of bringing an online digital media store on board for Windows Media Player. Windows Media Player supports two kinds of online stores: type 1 and type 2. For information about the difference between type 1 and type 2 stores, see [Windows Media Player Online Stores](windows-media-player-online-stores.md).

The on-boarding process described in the following sections applies to both type 1 and type 2 stores, except for a few differences, which are noted.

## Eligibility

To be eligible to have an online music store integrated with Windows Media Player, your company must meet the on-boarding requirements and maintenance requirements given in the online stores agreement. The types of requirements in the agreement include, but are not limited to, the following.

-   Your company must have the rights to distribute online content via Windows Media Player.
-   Your company must agree to make a certain number of tracks available to users of Windows Media Player.
-   Your company must provide a certain level of uninterrupted service.

Some specific requirements from the agreement are highlighted in [Requirements for Online Music Stores](requirements-for-online-music-stores.md).
