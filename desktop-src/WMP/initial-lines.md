# Initial Lines

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Every skin definition file for Windows Media Player Mobile must start with a line that specifies the skin file version number. The following line works for Windows Media Player 9 Series for Windows Mobile 2003 or later:


```C++
[Pocket WMP Skin File v9.0.1]

```
