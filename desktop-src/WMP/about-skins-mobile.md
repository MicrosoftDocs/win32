# About Skins (Mobile)

A skin is a customized user interface to Windows Media Player. You can create your own buttons to start and stop playback of digital media, add sliders to change volume and playback position in the media item, and provide the user with text information such as the name of a song. Best of all, you can add your own artwork or use existing art to create a unique appearance for your skin.

The basic steps in creating a skin are:

1.  **Design** your user interface. Decide which buttons, text boxes, and trackbars you want to provide to the user so that they can control the functions you chose in step 1. You may want to sketch out your ideas to see how they fit on the image size you will be working with.
2.  **Create** the art you want to show the user. This will consist of several images that show the background images, other images you may want to display, and mapping images if you use region buttons.
3.  **Write** the skin definition file that will link together the digital media functions, user interface, and images. You must follow certain rules for entering the text data into the file, but you can look at the default skin as a guide.

You do not need to follow these steps in the order given, but a good design will come from being aware of all the possibilities and taking care of all the details.

The following sections provide detailed information about skins.
