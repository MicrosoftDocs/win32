# Using the Windows Media Player Control with Firefox

Microsoft provides a plug-in that enables you to embed the Windows Media Player ActiveX control in a webpage so that it will be displayed correctly by a Firefox browser. The plug-in, which must be installed on the client computer, can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Port25 website](https://www.mozilla.org/).

For information about the Firefox browser, see the [Firefox website](https://www.mozilla.org/).

For more information about using Windows Media Player with Firefox, see the Windows Media Player section of the [mozillaZine website](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Windows_Media_Player).

The following topics describe how to embed the Windows Media Player control in a webpage that can be displayed correctly by both Internet Explorer and Firefox.
