# Getting Started with the Windows Media Player SDK

To create your plug-in, you first need to install Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ 4.0 and Visual Studio 2003. You must also install the Pocket PC 2003 SDK or the Smartphone 2003 SDK, which are separate downloads. To compile and run the project, a Pocket PC or Smartphone device running the Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition operating system must be synchronized with the development computer by using Microsoft ActiveSync® 3.7.1 or later.

Because UI plug-ins on Windows Mobile devices use the same plug-in model as the desktop versions, you can use the Windows Media Player Plug-in Wizard as a starting point when creating a background UI plug-in that will work with Windows Media Player 10 Mobile.

To create UI plug-in code, do the following:

1.  Open Visual Studio 2003, and start a new project in Visual C++.
2.  Select **Windows Media Player Plug-in Wizard** from the **Templates** pane.
3.  Name your project NetworkPlugin and click **OK**.
4.  Select **UI Plug-in** and click **Next**.
5.  Select **Background** and click **Next**.
6.  Click **Next** to finish the wizard. If you are going to monitor events with your plug-in, you must check **Listen to events** before finishing the wizard, and you should read the documentation for the **IWMPEvents** interface to find out which events are supported on Windows Media Player 10 Mobile.

Now that you have created your UI plug-in code, you need to create an empty Windows CE DLL project in eMbedded Visual C++ 4.0. Then copy your wizard-generated source files to that new project so that they will compile with the ARM4 compiler.

To create an empty project

1.  Start a new project in eMbedded Visual C++, and then select **WCE Dynamic-Link Library** from the **Projects** pane.
2.  Name your project and click **OK**.
3.  Make sure **An empty Windows CE DLL project** is selected, and then click **Finish**.
4.  Click the **Project** menu item.
5.  Select **Add to Project**, and then click **Files**.
6.  Select the C++ files you created with the plug-in wizard, and then click **OK**.
