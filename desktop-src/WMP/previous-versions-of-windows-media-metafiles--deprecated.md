# Previous Versions of Windows Media Metafiles (deprecated)

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This topic documents a feature that is no longer used in the current version of Windows Media Metafiles.

This section documents a portion of version 2 of Windows Media Metafiles. Version 2 is not the current version of Windows Media Metafiles, but there are some cases in which Windows Media Services supplies clients with metafiles that are in the version 2 format. Windows Media Metafiles are also referred to as Advanced Stream Redirector (ASX) files.

This section documents the following items.
