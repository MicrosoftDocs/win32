# Displaying Web Pages in Windows Media Player

The Windows Media Player HTMLView feature enables Internet content providers (ICPs) to use the **Now Playing** feature of the full mode Player to display Web-based content while digital media content is playing. (HTMLView is not supported by the Windows Media Player control.) In the past, ICPs had to display advertisements in separate Web browser windows (called "pop-up advertising") or had to add customized digital media players to their webpages. With HTMLView, ICPs can provide a personalized and integrated experience created specifically for Windows Media Player 9 Series and Windows Media Player 10, while ensuring that digital media content still plays back in earlier versions of Windows Media Player.
