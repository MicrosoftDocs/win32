# IWMPNetwork::downloadProgress property

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **downloadProgress** property gets the percentage of downloading completed.

## Syntax


```CSharp
public System.Int32 downloadProgress {get; set;}
```


```VB

Public ReadOnly Property downloadProgress As System.Int32
```





## Property value

A **System.Int32** that is the download progress expressed as a percentage.

## Remarks

When the Windows Media Player control is connected to a digital media file that can be played and downloaded at the same time, the **downloadProgress** property gets the percentage of the total file that has been downloaded. This feature is currently supported only for digital media files downloaded from web servers. A file of any of the following formats can be downloaded and played simultaneously:

-   Advanced Systems Format (ASF)
-   Windows Media Audio (WMA)
-   Windows Media Video (WMV)
-   MP3
-   MPEG
-   WAV

In addition, some AVI files can be downloaded and played simultaneously.

Use the **AxWindowsMediaPlayer.\_WMPOCXEvents\_BufferingEvent** to determine when buffering starts or stops.

## Examples

The following code example uses **downloadProgress** to display the percentage of downloading completed. The information is displayed in a label, in response to the **Buffering** Event. The example uses a timer with a 1-second interval to update the display. The **AxWMPLib.AxWindowsMediaPlayer** object is represented by the variable named player.


```CSharp
// Add a delegate for the Buffering event.
player.Buffering += new AxWMPLib._WMPOCXEvents_BufferingEventHandler(player_Buffering);

// Create an event handler for the Buffering event.
private void player_Buffering(object sender, AxWMPLib._WMPOCXEvents_BufferingEvent e)
{
    // Determine whether buffering has started or stopped.
    if (e.start == true)
    {
        // Set the timer interval at one second (1000 miliseconds).
        timer.Interval = 1000;
        
        // Start the timer.
        timer.Start();
    }
    else
    {
        // Buffering is complete. Stop the timer.
        timer.Stop();
    }
}

// Update the download progress in a timer event handler.
private void UpdateDownloadProgress(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    downloadProgressLabel.Text = ("Download progress: " + player.network.downloadProgress + " percent complete");
}
```


```VB

' Create an event handler for the Buffering event.
Public Sub player_Buffering(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As AxWMPLib._WMPOCXEvents_BufferingEvent) Handles player.Buffering

    &#39; Test whether packets may be arriving.
    Select Case e.newState

    &#39; If WMPPlayState is Stopped, Paused, ScanForward, ScanReverse, Waiting, MediaEnded
    &#39; or Transitioning then stop the timer. 
        Case 1
        Case 2
        Case 4
        Case 5
        Case 7
        Case 8
        Case 9
            timer.Stop()

        &#39; If WMPPlayState is Playing or Buffering then set the timer interval and start the timer.
        Case Else
            timer.Interval = 1000
            timer.Start()

    End Select

End Sub

&#39; Update the download progress in a timer event handler.
Public Sub UpdateDownloadProgress(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles timer.Tick

    downloadProgressLabel.Text = (&quot;Download progress: &quot; + player.network.downloadProgress + &quot; percent complete&quot;)

End Sub
```
