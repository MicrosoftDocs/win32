# Implementing Your Code

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Once you have completed the build process, you will probably want to improve upon the code generated by the wizard. Otherwise your visualization will look much like Bars. What you need to do is change the implementation of the **Render** function, and possibly the **RenderWindowed** function.

The following sections provide details about how to modify the sample code generated by the plug-in wizard:

-   [Implementing Render](implementing-render.md)
-   [Implementing Other Functions](implementing-other-functions.md)
-   [Presets](presets.md)
