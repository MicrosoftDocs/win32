# Implementing Your Code

Once you have completed the build process, you will probably want to improve upon the code generated by the wizard. Otherwise your visualization will look much like Bars. What you need to do is change the implementation of the **Render** function, and possibly the **RenderWindowed** function.

The following sections provide details about how to modify the sample code generated by the plug-in wizard:

-   [Implementing Render](implementing-render.md)
-   [Implementing Other Functions](implementing-other-functions.md)
-   [Presets](presets.md)
