# CUSTOMSLIDER.onPositionChange

The **onPositionChange** event handler handles an event that occurs when the position of the slider changes as a result of the user clicking or dragging.

``` syntax
onPositionChange
```

## Remarks

If the position of the custom slider changes as a result of the **value** attribute being modified in script, this event is not fired. To accommodate this possibility, implement the **value\_onchange** event handler instead.
