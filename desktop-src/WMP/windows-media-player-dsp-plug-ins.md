# Windows Media Player DSP Plug-ins

Microsoft Windows Media Player provides an architecture that enables the user to install and activate plug-in programs that add digital signal processing (DSP) functionality. A DSP plug-in is a Microsoft DirectX Media Object (DMO) or a Media Foundation Transform (MFT) that connects to the Player by using COM interfaces. A typical DSP plug-in might be an audio equalizer or a video tint control. This section of the SDK provides the programming information you need to create your own DSP plug-in.

The DSP plug-in documentation is divided into the following three sections.



| Section                                                                      | Description                                                                                                                                     |
