# Firewall Port Registry Settings

Windows Media Player places entries in the registry so that firewalls can determine whether to open or close the ports that are used by media library sharing.

**AcceptedEULA Registry Entry**

Windows Media Player uses the following registry entry to indicate whether the user has accepted the end user license agreement (EULA).


```C++
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\MediaPlayer\Preferences]
"AcceptedEULA" = dword:value
```



A value of 1 indicates that the user has accepted the license agreement. A value of 0 indicates that the user has not accepted the license agreement.

**WMPNSSFirewallPortsOpen Registry Entry**

Windows Media Player uses the following registry entry to indicate whether the user has chosen to share his or her media library with other computers on a home network.


```C++
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\MediaPlayer\Preferences]
"WMPNSSFirewallPortsOpen" = dword:value
```



A value of 1 indicates that the user has chosen to share the library. A value of 0 indicates that the user has chosen not to share the library.

**Ports Related to Media Library Sharing**

On Windows Vista, if the **WMPNSSFirewallPortsOpen** registry entry has a value of 1, the following ports should be open.
