# Controls.fastForward method

The **fastForward** method starts fast play of the media item in the forward direction.

## Syntax


```JScript
Controls.fastForward()
```



## Parameters

This method has no parameters.

## Return value

This method does not return a value.

## Remarks

The **fastForward** method plays the clip back at five times the normal speed. Invoking **fastForward** changes the *Settings*.**rate** property to 5.0. If **rate** is subsequently changed, or if **play** or **stop** is called, Windows Media Player will cease fast forwarding.

The **fastForward** method does not work for live broadcasts and certain media types. To determine whether you can fast forward in a clip, call **isAvailable**("FastForward").

## Examples

The following example creates an HTML BUTTON element that uses **fastForward** to start fast play of the media item. The **Player** object was created with ID = "Player".


```JScript
<INPUT TYPE = "BUTTON"  ID = "FF"  NAME = "FF"  VALUE = ">>"  

    /* Execute JScript when the BUTTON is clicked. 
       Check first to make sure fast-forward mode is available
       for this particular media item */
    onClick = "if (Player.controls.isAvailable('FastForward'))
        Player.controls.fastForward();
">

```
