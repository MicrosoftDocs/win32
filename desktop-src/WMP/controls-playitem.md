# Controls.playItem method

The **playItem** method plays the specified media item.

## Syntax


```JScript
Controls.playItem(
  theMediaItem
)
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*theMediaItem* \[in\]
</dt> <dd>

**Media** object to be played.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

This method does not return a value.

## Remarks

The media item will be loaded and played automatically, regardless of the value of the *Settings*.**autoStart** property. To load an item without playing it automatically, set *Settings*.**autoStart** to false and assign a value to *Player*.**URL**, after which **play** can be called to start playing the item.

Note

**playItem** works only with items in *currentPlaylist*. Calling **playItem** with a reference to a saved media item is not supported.

## Examples

The following JScript example uses **playItem** to play a media item from the current playlist. The item to play is chosen based upon its position in the playlist. The **Player** object was created with ID = "Player".


```JScript
// Declare a variable to hold the position of the media item 
// in the current playlist. An arbitrary value is supplied here.
var index = 3

// Retrieve the media item at the fourth position in the current playlist.
var media = Player.currentPlaylist.item(index);

// Play the media item.
Player.controls.playItem(media);

```
