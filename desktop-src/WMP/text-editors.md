# Text Editors

You must use a text editor that does not include any formatting characters. A simple text editor such as Notepad is recommended, though development environments such as Microsoft Visual Studio offer advanced features. You should not use an editor such as Microsoft Word, because the default Word file format saves extra formatting codes that will not be useable. If you use a word processor such as Word, you must remember to save your work as unformatted text every time you save your file.

You should probably turn off word wrap if your text editor allows it, and you may want to turn on the ability to view all characters to make sure you do not accidentally add any tabs or other control characters. Remember, including tab characters in your skin definition file will cause the skin to fail.
