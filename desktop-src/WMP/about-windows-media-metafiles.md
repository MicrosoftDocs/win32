# About Windows Media Metafiles

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Microsoft Windows Media metafiles are text files that provide information about a file stream and its presentation. Windows Media metafiles are based on the Extensible Markup Language (XML) syntax and can be encoded in ANSI or UNICODE (UTF-8) format. They are made up of various elements with their associated tags and attributes. Each element in a Windows Media metafile defines a particular setting or action in Windows Media Player. Some elements must be located in a specific position in the file relative to other elements. Some elements have required tags and attributes that must be defined in the Windows Media metafile.

Windows Media Download packages provide a way to combine Windows Media Player borders, playlist information, and multimedia content into a single downloadable file.

The following sections provide conceptual information about Windows Media metafile playlists and Windows Media Download packages.
