# Windows Media Metafile Guide

A Windows Media metafile can be as simple or complex as you need it to be. The most basic Windows Media metafile contains only the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of some multimedia content on a server. The client, Windows Media Player, parses this information and then opens the media file or stream defined in the Windows Media metafile. A complex metafile can contain multiple files or streams arranged in a playlist, instructions on how to play the files or streams, text and graphic elements such as title, author, and copyright text, personalized ad insertion into a live stream, hyperlinks associated with elements on the Windows Media Player interface, and more.

The following sections provide detailed information on how to create and use Windows Media metafile playlists.
