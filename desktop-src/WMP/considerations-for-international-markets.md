# Considerations for International Markets

If your company creates online stores for multiple markets, you must provide Microsoft with the URL of a ServiceInfo document for each market. You can do this one of the following two ways:

-   Create a separate ServiceInfo document for each market. In this case, you provide Microsoft with URLs that point to individual ServiceInfo documents for each online store in each market.
-   Create a single ServiceInfo document for all markets. When you do this, you provide Microsoft with the same URL for each market. Your ServiceInfo document, created as an ASP page, can then dynamically detect the user's location based on query string parameters.

Windows Media Player appends a query string to the ServiceInfo URL request that provides information about the user's locale and location settings. If your online store uses this information to determine which content to display, you should dynamically append these values to your own URLs in your ServiceInfo document. This is the best way to ensure that your webpage URLs will always contain the parameters you expect.

Once you have determined the user's location and language preference, you may want to persist this information for future sessions. You can do this using any of the techniques you would normally use in a webpage, such as cookies, or by using your COM object.
