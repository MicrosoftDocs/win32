# Image Sizes

You must take the display area size into consideration when creating artwork for skins. The following table shows the display area sizes for different screen configurations.



| DPI (mode)                    | Width in pixels | Height in pixels |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 96 (portrait)                 | 240             | 320              |
| 96 (landscape)                | 320             | 240              |
| 192 (portrait)                | 480             | 640              |
| 192 (landscape)               | 640             | 220              |
| 96 (square)                   | 240             | 240              |
| 192 (square)                  | 480             | 480              |
| 96 (portrait for Smartphone)  | 176             | 220              |
| 131 (portrait for Smartphone) | 240             | 320              |



 

> [!Note]  
> Versions earlier than Windows Media Player 9 Series for Windows Mobile 2003 support only 96 DPI portrait-mode skins. Windows Media Player 10 Mobile or later supports 131 DPI portrait-mode skins on Smartphone devices, and this support is expected to continue in future versions of Windows Media Player Mobile.
