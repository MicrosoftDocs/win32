# MediaCollection.getByAuthor method

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **getByAuthor** method retrieves a playlist of the media items by the specified author.

## Syntax


```JScript
retVal = MediaCollection.getByAuthor(
  author
)
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*author* \[in\]
</dt> <dd>

**String** containing the name of the author.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

This method returns a **Playlist** object.

## Remarks

To use this method, read access to the library is required. For more information, see [Library Access](library-access.md).

## Examples

The following JScript example uses *MediaCollection*.**getByAuthor** to retrieve a playlist of media items. The playlist contains items matching the author specified by the user in an HTML TEXT input element named GetAuthor. The **Player** object was created with ID = "Player".


```JScript
<!-- Use an HTML BUTTON element to create the playlist and play the media items. -->
<INPUT TYPE = "BUTTON"  NAME = "PlayAuthor"  
       ID = "PlayAuthor"  
       VALUE = "Play Author"

onClick = "
    /* Retrieve the author name text from the user. */
    var author = GetAuthor.value;

    /* Create the playlist by using getByAuthor. */
    var pl = Player.mediaCollection.getByAuthor(Author);

    /* Make the new playlist the current playlist. */
    Player.currentPlaylist = pl;

    /* Play the media items in the new playlist. */
               Player.controls.play();
">

```
