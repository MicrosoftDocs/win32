# Player Control Guide

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The Microsoft Windows Media Player ActiveX control object model exposes objects, methods, properties, and events that you can use in skins and when you embed the control in webpages or custom programs.

The following topics describe several ways to use the embedded Windows Media Player control.
