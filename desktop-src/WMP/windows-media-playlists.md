# Windows Media Playlists

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This reference documents Windows Media Playlists. A Windows Media Playlist (WPL) is a file that uses the elements documented in this reference to define either a dynamic "smart" playlist of media items or a static set of media items.

This reference contains the following sections.
