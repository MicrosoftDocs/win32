# Windows Media Player Object Model Reference

The Windows Media Player Object Model Reference sections contain detailed information about the Windows Media Player ActiveX control object model. The object model provides interfaces that let developers add Windows Media Player functionality to webpages, C++ programs, and .NET applications.

The Object Model Reference for Scripting is presented in a style designed for use with script languages like Microsoft JScript, and it documents the object model in terms of objects with their associated properties, methods, and events.

The Object Model Reference for C++ provides documentation for COM interfaces that C++ programmers can use to communicate with the Windows Media Player ActiveX control or the Windows Media Player Mobile ActiveX control. Most of these interfaces are implemented by Windows Media Player control and called by the C++ application. However, some of the interfaces (for example, **IWMPEvents** and **IWMPRemoteMediaServices**) are implemented by the C++ application and called by the Windows Media Player control.

The Object Model Reference for Visual Basic .NET and C# provides documentation for the properties, methods, and events of the **AxWindowsMediaPlayer** object and for interfaces to the Windows Media Player ActiveX control that are available through COM interoperability in a solution coded in Visual Studio .NET 2002 or later.

The Windows Media Player Object Model Reference contains the following sections.
