# About the Sample Video DSP Plug-in

The sample video DSP plug-in provides a simple processing implementation that scales the color saturation of the video by a factor provided by the user in the property page. The plug-in accepts values between zero and 1. The default value is 1. A value of 1 has no effect upon the video image; other scale factors desaturate the image color. For instance, a value of .5 would result in 50 percent color saturation. A value of zero results in grayscale video.

The sample video DSP plug-in works with the following video formats:

-   NV12
-   YV12
-   YUY2
-   UYVY
-   RGB32
-   RGB24
-   RGB555
-   RGB565
