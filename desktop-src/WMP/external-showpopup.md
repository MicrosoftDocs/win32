# External.showPopup method

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **showPopup** method instructs Windows Media Player to display a pop-up webpage; that is, a webpage that appears in a separate window.

## Syntax


```JScript
External.showPopup(
  PopupIndex,
  Parameters
)
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*PopupIndex* \[in\]
</dt> <dd>

**Number** (**long**) that specifies the index of the pop-up webpage.

</dd> <dt>

*Parameters* \[in\]
</dt> <dd>

**String** that Windows Media Player appends to the URL of the webpage.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

This method does not return a value.

## Remarks

The pop-up index is not interpreted by Windows Media Player. Indexes that identify pop-up webpages are created by the online store, and have meaning only to the online store.

The following steps show how Windows Media Player uses the parameters of the **showPopup** method to create a URL for the popup window.

1.  Script on a discovery page calls **showPopup**, passing an integer in *PopupIndex* and a string in *Parameters*.

2.  Windows Media Player passes the index to [IWMPContentPartner::GetItemInfo](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/contentpartner/nf-contentpartner-iwmpcontentpartner-getiteminfo) to retrieve the URL of the webpage to be displayed.

3.  Windows Media Player appends *Parameters* to the URL as a query string. For example, if **GetItemInfo** returns "https://www.Proseware.com/Pages/Popup1.htm" and *Parameters* is equal to "DlgX=800&DlgY=400&Greeting=Hi", Windows Media Player creates the following URL:

    ```https://www.Proseware.com/Pages/Popup1.htm?DlgX=800&DlgY=400&Greeting=Hi```

You can use *Parameters* to specify the size of the pop-up window. For example, if you set *Parameters* to "DlgX=800&DlgY=400", the pop-up window will have a size of 800 pixels by 400 pixels.
