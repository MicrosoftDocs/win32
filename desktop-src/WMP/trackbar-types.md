# Trackbar Types

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

You do not need to include sliders or trackbars, but they can be very useful for letting the user adjust volume and playback position. There are two types of trackbars:

-   Seek
-   Volume

For more information about sliders, see the [Trackbars](trackbars.md) section of the Skin Reference.
