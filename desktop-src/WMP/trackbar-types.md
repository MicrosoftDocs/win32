# Trackbar Types

You do not need to include sliders or trackbars, but they can be very useful for letting the user adjust volume and playback position. There are two types of trackbars:

-   Seek
-   Volume

For more information about sliders, see the [Trackbars](trackbars.md) section of the Skin Reference.
