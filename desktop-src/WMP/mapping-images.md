# Mapping Images

Mapping images are used for specific controls to specify which regions will respond to mouse clicks and to determine which controls receive which events. The mapping image must be the same height and width as the primary image and should be created so that the images in both files line up exactly. For this reason, a graphics editing program that supports layers is recommended because you can be certain your images are perfectly aligned.

Different controls require different types of mapping. A **ButtonElement** element needs a map that has a different color for each button. The colored areas in the mapping file must correspond to the areas of the buttons you want to map.
