# Creating the Art

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The art for this skin was created using Adobe Photoshop. Other graphics editing programs, such as Jasc Paint Shop Pro or Microsoft Paint, could have been used. Photoshop was chosen as an example of a graphics editing application that supports layers, which are helpful for creating multiple bitmap files that will line up with each other.

The following steps were used to create the art. Many other art procedures and tools can be used; this is just one way to do it. The important thing to keep in mind is that you want to end up with the specific bitmap files you need for your skin.
