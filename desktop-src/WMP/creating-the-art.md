# Creating the Art

The art for this skin was created using Adobe Photoshop. Other graphics editing programs, such as Jasc Paint Shop Pro or Microsoft Paint, could have been used. Photoshop was chosen as an example of a graphics editing application that supports layers, which are helpful for creating multiple bitmap files that will line up with each other.

The following steps were used to create the art. Many other art procedures and tools can be used; this is just one way to do it. The important thing to keep in mind is that you want to end up with the specific bitmap files you need for your skin.
