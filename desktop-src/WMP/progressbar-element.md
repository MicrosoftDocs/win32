# PROGRESSBAR Element

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **PROGRESSBAR** element provides a way to display progress information in a horizontal or vertical control. This element is identical to the **SLIDER** element. A progress bar is normally a slider that is not interactive, but there is nothing that prevents it from being used interactively. This element is provided solely as a convenience tag for making the noninteractivity clear in your code, if you choose to use it that way. It has no other value.
