# Player.OpenStateChange event

The **OpenStateChange** event occurs when the **openState** property changes value.

## Syntax


```JScript
Player.OpenStateChange(
  NewState
)
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*NewState* 
</dt> <dd>

**Number** (**long**) specifying the new open state. See [openState](player-openstate.md) for a table of values.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

This event does not return a value.

## Remarks

Windows Media Player can go through several open states while it attempts to open a network file, such as locating the server, connecting to the server, and finally opening the file. This event will be fired each time the open state changes.

The value of event parameters is specified by Windows Media Player, and can be accessed or passed to a method in an imported JScript file using the parameter name given. This parameter name must be typed exactly as shown, including capitalization.

Windows Media Player states are not guaranteed to occur in any particular order. Furthermore, not every state necessarily occurs during a sequence of events. You should not write code that relies upon state order.

## Requirements



| Requirement | Value |
