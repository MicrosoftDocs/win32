# Creating the Disabled File

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The Disabled file is similar to the Pushed file except that another color (red) is used to show when something is disabled.

The following image is the Disabled file.

Note that files like this one could be trimmed on the right and bottom sides. The actual size of the bitmap is not important, only that the elements line up with the Region bitmap for hit testing, as measured from the top left corners (including offsets).
