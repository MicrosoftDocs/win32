# Creating the Disabled File

The Disabled file is similar to the Pushed file except that another color (red) is used to show when something is disabled.

The following image is the Disabled file.

Note that files like this one could be trimmed on the right and bottom sides. The actual size of the bitmap is not important, only that the elements line up with the Region bitmap for hit testing, as measured from the top left corners (including offsets).
