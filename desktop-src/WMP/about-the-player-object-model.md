# About the Player Object Model

The Microsoft Windows Media Player control is a standard ActiveX control that uses Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) technology. The Windows Media Player functionality is distilled into a set of programming interfaces that follows standard COM guidelines. You can program these interfaces on a standard HTML webpage using the Player control object model with Microsoft JScript or Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript). You can also program them in skins by using Microsoft JScript. If you want to create a custom program that embeds the control, you can use one of several languages, including Visual Basic, C++, and C#.

The Windows Media Player ActiveX control is installed with Windows Media Player. The Player control is not installed with the Windows Media Player SDK and cannot be redistributed separately. The particular features available to your code depend on which version of Windows Media Player the user has installed. The [Object Model Reference for Scripting](object-model-reference-for-scripting.md) and [Object Model Reference for C++](object-model-reference-for-c.md) include version requirement information for each property, method, and event.

The following sections provide overview information about the Windows Media Player object model.
