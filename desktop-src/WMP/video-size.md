# Video Size

You can specify the size of the video display area up to the maximum size of the device display. However, such a large display area would cover all the controls your skin exposes, making them useless while video is playing. If the video display area is larger than the dimensions of the video that is playing, the video will be displayed at actual size and the unused portions of the video display will appear as a black border around the video image. If the video display area is smaller than the dimensions of the video that is playing, the video will still be displayed at actual size, but will appear centered and cropped within the available display area.

The following table shows recommended standard video display sizes.



| DPI | Width in pixels | Height in pixels |
|-----|-----------------|------------------|
| 96  | 208             | 160              |
| 192 | 516             | 320              |
