# ClosedCaption.captioningID

The **captioningID** property specifies or retrieves the name of the element displaying the captioning.

``` syntax
player.closedCaption.captioningID
```

## Possible Values

This property is a read/write **String**.

## Remarks

The element name specified can be any HTML element in the webpage as long as it supports the innerHTML attribute. If the webpage contains multiple frames, the element name can only refer to an element in the same frame as the Player control.

**Windows Media Player 10 Mobile:** This property is read only, and always returns an empty string.

## Examples

The following Microsoft JScript example uses *ClosedCaption*.**captioningID** to choose the area of a webpage used to display captions. Two HTML DIV elements were created, with ID = CC1 and ID = CC2, respectively. The **Player** object was created with ID = "Player".


```JScript
<!-- Create two HTML BUTTON elements to allow the user to choose a display region. -->
<INPUT TYPE = "BUTTON"  NAME = "SET1"  VALUE = "Move Caption to CC1"
       OnClick = "
           /* Clear the caption text from the other DIV */
           CC2.innerHTML = 'This is the CC2 DIV';

           /* Show the captions in the DIV named CC1. */ 
           Player.ClosedCaption.captioningID = 'CC1';
          ">

<INPUT TYPE = "BUTTON" NAME = "SET2" VALUE = "Move Caption to CC2"
       OnClick = "
           /* Clear the caption text from the other DIV */
           CC1.innerHTML = 'This is the CC1 DIV';

           /* Show the captions in the DIV named CC2. */
           Player.ClosedCaption.captioningID = 'CC2';
          ">

```
