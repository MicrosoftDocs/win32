# Player.newPlaylist method

The **newPlaylist** method creates a new **Playlist** object.

## Syntax


```JScript
retVal = Player.newPlaylist(
  name,
  URL
)
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*name* \[in\]
</dt> <dd>

**String** containing the name of the new playlist.

</dd> <dt>

*URL* \[in\]
</dt> <dd>

**String** containing the URL of the Windows Media metafile playlist to create the **Playlist** object with.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

This method returns a **Playlist** object.

## Remarks

If the *URL* parameter is set to null or "" (empty string), an empty **Playlist** object will be created. If the *name* parameter is set to "", the name in the metafile is used.

The new playlist created with this method is not added to the library. To add a new playlist to the library, use *PlaylistCollection*.**importPlaylist** or *PlaylistCollection*.**newPlaylist**. Any leading or trailing spaces in the playlist name are automatically removed when it is added to the library.

Because the library allows multiple playlists with the same name, you may want to check for the presence of a playlist with a given name before adding a new one.

## Requirements



| Requirement | Value |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version<br/> | Windows Media Player 9 Series or later.<br/>                                 |
| DLL<br/>     | <dl> <dt>Wmp.dll</dt> </dl> |
