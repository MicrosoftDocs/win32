# Creating the Skin Definition File

The skin definition file is a simple text file. You can create skin definition files in any text editor that saves ASCII plain text files, such as Microsoft Notepad, Microsoft Visual InterDev®, or Microsoft Visual Studio. Since you will be writing XML, not HTML, you may not want to use an editor for HTML because it may add extra codes you do not want or may tell you about errors that you do not have. You will probably want to avoid word processors such as Microsoft Word; even though Word can save plain text files, you may not want to remember to save as text every time you save.

The following sections will guide you in creating a skin definition file:

-   [Skin Definition File XML Structure](skin-definition-file-xml-structure.md)

-   [Adding BUTTONGROUP](adding-buttongroup.md)
-   [Adding the Play BUTTONELEMENT](adding-the-play-buttonelement.md)
-   [Adding the Close BUTTONELEMENT](adding-the-close-buttonelement.md)
