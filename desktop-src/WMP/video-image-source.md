# Video Image Source

There is no separate image required for the video display area. You might want to create an area in your background image, which will be displayed by default, to act as a placeholder. Make the area rectangular in shape, with the same width and height that you want to specify in your skin definition file. When video plays, the video will be superimposed over that area in your background file.
