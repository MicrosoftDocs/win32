# Video Image Source

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

There is no separate image required for the video display area. You might want to create an area in your background image, which will be displayed by default, to act as a placeholder. Make the area rectangular in shape, with the same width and height that you want to specify in your skin definition file. When video plays, the video will be superimposed over that area in your background file.
