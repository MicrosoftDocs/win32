# Art File Formats (Mobile)

Art files for skins may be either bitmap (.bmp) or GIF (.gif) images. JPEG (.jpg) and PNG (.png) images are also supported. Do not include any spaces or commas in your art file name.

If you are synchronizing files to a portable device, be sure that the synchronization does not change the file name extension or convert the image files to another format.

Many drawing programs can be used to create bitmaps and GIF files, or to convert art in other formats to bitmaps or GIF files. For example, you can use Microsoft Paint, which comes with Microsoft Windows, for simple drawings.

You will want to trim the blank areas of your images around the edges to reduce file size. You can use the offsets in the Bitmaps section to compensate for removing blank spaces on the left and top sides. You can also trim the bottom and right blank edges of the images because they are not needed for measurements. The only files you should not trim are the Background, SeekThumb, and VolumeThumb images.
