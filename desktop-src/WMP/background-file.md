# Background File

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Every skin needs a Background file, which contains the image that the user will see when the skin is first displayed. This file is defined as the Background file in the skin definition file.

The following image is a typical Background file.

This is the background image that users will see at first. However, they will also see the two thumb images at the appropriate locations on the trackbars for Seek (above) and Volume (below). In addition, any buttons that are disabled will be displayed using their Disabled images instead.
