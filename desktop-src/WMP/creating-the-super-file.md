# Creating the Super File

The Super file contains the disabled image for trackbars.

> [!Note]  
> Super files are not used in skins for Windows Media Player 10 Mobile or later because the disabled images for seek trackbars are located in the seekthumb file.

 

The following image is the Super file.
