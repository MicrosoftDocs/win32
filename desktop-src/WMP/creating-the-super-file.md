# Creating the Super File

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The Super file contains the disabled image for trackbars.

> [!Note]  
> Super files are not used in skins for Windows Media Player 10 Mobile or later because the disabled images for seek trackbars are located in the seekthumb file.

 

The following image is the Super file.
