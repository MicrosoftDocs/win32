# Skin Definition File (Mobile)

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The skin definition file is where you put all the pieces together. You define the images to use, specify the user interface elements you want the user to see, and type in the functions, coordinates, file names, and so on.

The following sections provide details about creating the skin definition file:
