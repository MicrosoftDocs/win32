# Building a Visualization

You can build a custom visualization by using Visual Studio along with the Windows Media Player plug-in wizard. For information on setting up the wizard and building a plug-in, see [Building a Plug-in](building-a-plug-in.md).

When you run the wizard, you will be given a choice of several different types of plug-ins. Choose Visualization.

After you complete the wizard and build your plug-in, start a song in Windows Media Player and click through the visualizations. The presets that are automatically built for you are called *projectname* Bars and *projectname* Wave, where *projectname* is the name of your project.
