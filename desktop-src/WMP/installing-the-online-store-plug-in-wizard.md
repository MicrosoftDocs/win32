# Installing the Online Store Plug-in Wizard

To set up your development environment for creating type 1 online store plug-ins, you must install the following items:

-   Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 or later
-   Windows Media Player 11 or later
-   Windows SDK, which includes the Windows Media Player SDK
-   Online store plug-in wizard

## Installing the Wizard

Use the following steps to install the online store plug-in wizard in Visual Studio.

1.  Locate the folder where you installed the Windows SDK. Expand the folder to view its subfolders, and navigate to Samples\\Multimedia\\WMP\\wizards\\services.
2.  Locate the following three files:
    -   wmpservices.vsz
    -   wmpservices.vsdir
    -   wmpservices.ico
3.  Using a text editor such as Notepad, edit the wmpservices.vsz file.

    Locate the following line:

    ```
    Wizard=VsWizard.<VsWizardEngine version goes here>
    ```

    

    Change `<VsWizardEngine version goes here>` to one of the following values, depending on which version of Visual Studio you have installed.

    

    | Value              | Visual Studio version |
    |--------------------|-----------------------|
    | VsWizardEngine.8.0 | Visual Studio 2005    |
    | VsWizardEngine.9.0 | Visual Studio 2008    |

    

     

    Locate the following line:

    ```
    Param="ABSOLUTE_PATH = <path to wmpservices directory goes here>"
    ```

    

    Change `<path to wmpservices directory goes here>` to the path where the wizard files are located.

    For example, suppose you have Visual Studio 2008, and your wizard files are here: C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v7.0\\Samples\\Multimedia\\WMP\\wizards\\services. Then your wmpservices.vsz file would look like this:

    ```
    VSWIZARD 7.0
    Wizard=VsWizard.VsWizardEngine.9.0

    Param="WIZARD_NAME = wmpservices"
    Param="ABSOLUTE_PATH = C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0\Samples\Multimedia\WMP\wizards\services"
    Param="FALLBACK_LCID = 1033"
    ```

    

4.  Locate the folder where you installed Visual Studio. Expand the folder to view its subfolders, and locate a folder named vcprojects.
5.  Copy the three files listed in step 2 to the vcprojects folder. The wizard is now installed.
