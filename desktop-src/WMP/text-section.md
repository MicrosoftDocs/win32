# Text Section

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

No text section is used in this skin, but the following is an example of the format you should use when implementing a text section:


```C++
[ Text ]

//  <Item>       <Location>     <Align>  <Font>          <Color>
//  ------       ----------     -------  ------          -------

```
