# Information Common to Type 1 and Type 2 Online Stores

> [!Note]  
> This section describes functionality designed for use by online stores. Use of this functionality outside the context of an online store is not supported.

 

Windows Media Player supports two kinds of online stores: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 stores are supported by Windows Media Player 11. Type 2 stores are supported by Windows Media Player 10 and Windows Media Player 11. Type 2 stores provide a basic level of integration with the Player's user interface, and Type 1 stores provide a deeper integration. For more information about the difference between type 1 and type 2 stores, see [Windows Media Player Online Stores](windows-media-player-online-stores.md).

The following sections provide information that applies to both type 1 and type 2 online stores.
