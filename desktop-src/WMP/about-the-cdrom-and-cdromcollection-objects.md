# About the Cdrom and CdromCollection Objects

The **Cdrom** and **CdromCollection** objects govern the interface to the CD drives in your computer for purposes of reading and playing CDs.

The **CdromCollection** object is accessed only through the **cdromCollection** property of the **Player** object. The **cdromCollection** property returns the **CdromCollection** object. You can only access the properties of the **CdromCollection** object after you have created it. For example, to use the **count** property, you must use the following code:


```C++
mycount = player.cdromcollection.count;
```



You can only access the **Cdrom** object through the **CdromCollection** object. For example, to eject the CD by using the **Eject** method, you must first create the collection object and then an item in the object. To eject the CD, use the following code:


```C++
player.cdromcollection.item(0).eject();
```



In both cases, you are first creating the collection object (**CdromCollection**) and then getting a specific object of that collection. The object is the first item in the collection, **Item**(0), which corresponds to the first CD drive. You then call a method, **Eject**, on that item.
