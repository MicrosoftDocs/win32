# MediaCollection.getByName method

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **getByName** method retrieves a playlist of the media items with the specified name.

## Syntax


```JScript
retVal = MediaCollection.getByName(
  name
)
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*name* \[in\]
</dt> <dd>

**String** containing the name.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

This method returns a **Playlist** object.

## Remarks

To use this method, read access to the library is required. For more information, see [Library Access](library-access.md).

## Examples

The following JScript example uses *MediaCollection*.**getByName** to retrieve three items from the library. Each item is then appended to the current playlist. The **Player** object was created with ID="Player".


```JScript
// In each case, use the name exactly as it appears in the library.
// Windows Media Player does not include file name extensions or file paths
// in the name. Internet URLs include the entire path, but not the 
// file name extension.

// Get a playlist object that contains an Internet URL.
var One = Player.mediaCollection.getByName("https://www.proseware.com/Media/Laure");
 
// Get a playlist object that contains a file on a network server.
var Two = Player.mediaCollection.getByName("Jeanne");

// Get a playlist object that contains a file on a local drive.
var Three = Player.mediaCollection.getByName("house");

// Append each item to the current playlist. Since each playlist retrieved
// using getByName contains one digital media item, use Playlist.item with
// an index of zero to reference that item.
Player.currentPlaylist.appendItem(One.item(0));
Player.currentPlaylist.appendItem(Two.item(0));
Player.currentPlaylist.appendItem(Three.item(0));

```
