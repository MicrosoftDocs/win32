# Metadata Area Plug-ins (deprecated)

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This page documents a feature that may be unavailable in future versions of Windows Media Player and the Windows Media Player SDK.

Metadata area UI plug-ins are shown in the metadata area of the **Now Playing** pane to the right of the main visual area and the Tools pane, and below the playlist view (if it is enabled). Only one metadata area plug-in can be enabled at a time.

Metadata area plug-ins are useful for displaying concise information about the currently playing media item, simple controls, or hyperlinks to additional information.
