# Metadata Area Plug-ins (deprecated)

This page documents a feature that may be unavailable in future versions of Windows Media Player and the Windows Media Player SDK.

Metadata area UI plug-ins are shown in the metadata area of the **Now Playing** pane to the right of the main visual area and the Tools pane, and below the playlist view (if it is enabled). Only one metadata area plug-in can be enabled at a time.

Metadata area plug-ins are useful for displaying concise information about the currently playing media item, simple controls, or hyperlinks to additional information.
