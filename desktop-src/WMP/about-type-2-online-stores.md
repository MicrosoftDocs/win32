# About Type 2 Online Stores

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

> This section describes functionality designed for use by online stores. Use of this functionality outside the context of an online store is not supported.

 

Windows Media Player supports two kinds of online stores: type1 and type 2. Type 1 stores are supported by Windows Media Player 11. Type 2 stores are supported by Windows Media Player 10 and Windows Media Player 11. Type 2 stores provide a basic level of integration with the Player's user interface, and type 1 stores provide a deeper integration. For more information about the difference between type 1 and type 2 stores, see [Windows Media Player Online Stores](windows-media-player-online-stores.md).
