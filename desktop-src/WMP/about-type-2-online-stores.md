# About Type 2 Online Stores

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Windows Media Player supports two kinds of online stores: type1 and type 2. Type 1 stores are supported by Windows Media Player 11. Type 2 stores are supported by Windows Media Player 10 and Windows Media Player 11. Type 2 stores provide a basic level of integration with the Player's user interface, and type 1 stores provide a deeper integration. For more information about the difference between type 1 and type 2 stores, see [Windows Media Player Online Stores](windows-media-player-online-stores.md).
