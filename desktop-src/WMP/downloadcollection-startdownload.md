| Value      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| background | (Windows XP and later.) The download occurs as a background process as processor time becomes available. Download states persist even when Windows Media Player or Windows XP is shut down. |
| real time  | (All supported operating systems.) The download occurs all at once. No download states persist between sessions.                                                                            |



 

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

This method returns a **DownloadItem** object.

## Remarks

When a new download is started, Download Manager adds it as an item to the download collection that initiated the download.

Only the following digital media formats can be downloaded:

-   Advanced Systems Format (ASF)
-   MP3
-   Windows Media Audio (WMA)
-   Windows Media Video (WMV)

The *sourceURL* parameter does not support Unicode-encoded strings. It must point to valid content. Redirects are not supported.

When using Windows XP, audio files are automatically placed into appropriate **My Music** subfolders based upon file-level metadata values. Video files are placed into \\My Music\\download\\*random number*\\*type*, where *random number* is a random value generated by Windows Media Player for each user, and *type* is either "real time" or "background", depending upon the download type.

When using Windows Media Player 9 Series with Windows 98 and Windows Millennium Edition (ME), audio and video files are placed into \\My Music\\download\\*random number*\\*type*, where *random number* is a random value generated by the Player for each user, and *type* is either "real time" or "background", depending upon the download type.

Note that files may be renamed based upon metadata attributes contained in the file and rules specified by the user in the **Options** dialog box. Files that don't contain metadata, such as **Album** or **Artist**, may be moved to folders labeled Unknown Artist or Unknown Album.

## Requirements
