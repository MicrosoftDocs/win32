# Rules for Each Line

Each definition in the skin definition file must be on a separate line. You must enter text in lines using the following rules:

-   Each line must end with a paragraph return. Some lines may be longer than the visible line length of your text editor, but do not break the lines. You may want to turn line wrap off to be sure your lines do not break.
-   Use only visible characters as defined in the Skin Reference.
-   A line consists of one or more items, separated by spaces.
-   You can enter as many spaces between items as you want for readability.
-   Do not use any tab characters anywhere in the file.
-   Lines that begin with two consecutive forward slashes (//) are ignored. Use these for comments. Blank lines are also ignored.
-   Include spaces between the brackets and the name of the section.
