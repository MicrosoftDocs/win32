# IWMPMediaCollection::getByName method

The `getByName` method returns an **IWMPPlaylist** interface that provides access to media items with the specified name.

## Syntax


```CSharp
public IWMPPlaylist getByName(
  System.String bstrName
);
```


```VB

Public Function getByName( _
  ByVal bstrName As System.String _
) As IWMPPlaylist
Implements IWMPMediaCollection.getByName
```





## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*bstrName* \[in\]
</dt> <dd>

The **System.String** that is the specified name.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

A **WMPLib.IWMPPlaylist** interface for the retrieved media items.

## Remarks

Before calling this method, you must have read access to the library. For more information, see [Library Access](library-access.md).

There are two ways you ways you can retrieve an **IWMPMediaCollection** interface, and the behavior of the `getByName` method depends on which of those two ways you use. If you retrieve the interface by calling [AxWindowsMediaPlayer.mediaCollection](axwmplib-axwindowsmediaplayer-mediacollection--vb-and-c.md), then the `getByName` method returns all the media items in the library. However, if you retrieve the interface by calling [IWMPLibrary.mediaCollection](wmplibiwmplibrary-iwmplibrary-mediacollection--vb-and-c.md), then the `getByName` method returns only the audio items in the library that have the specified attribute and value.

## Examples

The following example uses `getByName` to retrieve three items from the library. Each item is then appended to the current playlist. The **AxWMPLib.AxWindowsMediaPlayer** object is represented by the variable named player.


```CSharp
// In each case, use the name exactly as it appears in the library.
// Windows Media Player does not include file name extensions or file paths
// in the name. Internet URLs include the entire path, but not the 
// file name extension.

// Get an interface to a playlist that contains an Internet URL.
WMPLib.IWMPPlaylist one = player.mediaCollection.getByName("https://www.proseware.com/Media/Laure");

// Get an interface to a playlist that contains a file on a network server.
WMPLib.IWMPPlaylist two = player.mediaCollection.getByName("Jeanne");

// Get an interface to a playlist that contains a file on a local drive.
WMPLib.IWMPPlaylist three = player.mediaCollection.getByName("house");

// Append each item to the current playlist. Since each playlist retrieved
// using getByName contains one digital media item, use the get_Item
// method with an index of zero to reference that item.
player.currentPlaylist.appendItem(one.get_Item(0));
player.currentPlaylist.appendItem(two.get_Item(0));
player.currentPlaylist.appendItem(three.get_Item(0));
```


```VB

' In each case, use the name exactly as it appears in the library.
&#39; Windows Media Player does not include file name extensions or file paths
&#39; in the name. Internet URLs include the entire path, but not the 
&#39; file name extension.

&#39; Get an interface to a playlist that contains an Internet URL.
Dim one As WMPLib.IWMPPlaylist = player.mediaCollection.getByName(&quot;https://www.proseware.com/Media/Laure&quot;)

&#39; Get an interface to a playlist that contains a file on a network server.
Dim two As WMPLib.IWMPPlaylist = player.mediaCollection.getByName(&quot;Jeanne&quot;)

&#39; Get an interface to a playlist that contains a file on a local drive.
Dim three As WMPLib.IWMPPlaylist = player.mediaCollection.getByName(&quot;house&quot;)

&#39; Append each item to the current playlist. Since each playlist retrieved
&#39; using getByName contains one digital media item, use the Item
&#39; property with an index of zero to reference that item.
player.currentPlaylist.appendItem(one.Item(0))
player.currentPlaylist.appendItem(two.Item(0))
player.currentPlaylist.appendItem(three.Item(0))
```
