# About the PlayerApplication Object

The **PlayerApplication** object is used for remoting Windows Media Player. It provides the functionality required to switch between a remoted Windows Media Player control and the full mode of the Player.

Remoting enables a Windows Media Player control embedded in a C++ application to use the same playback engine as the Player. This means that usually you will use the **PlayerApplication** object in C++ code using the COM interfaces. There is a special case, however, where you can embed the Windows Media Player control that displays a Windows Media Player skin as its user interface. In this case, **PlayerApplication** can be programmed using JScript in the skin code.
