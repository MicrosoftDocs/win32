# Building a UI Plug-in

You can build a UI plug-in by using Visual Studio and the Windows Media Player plug-in wizard. For information on setting up the wizard and building a plug-in, see [Building a Plug-in](building-a-plug-in.md).

When you run the wizard, you will be given a choice of several different types of plug-ins. Choose UI Plug-in.

The wizard creates a UI plug-in that you can use as a starting point. The following topic explains how to customize the plug-in for your own purposes:
