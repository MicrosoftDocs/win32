# Embedding the Windows Media Player Control

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

In addition to embedding the Windows Media Player control in a webpage as described in the previous section, you can embed it in Microsoft Office documents and in custom programs that you create using one of several programming languages, including Microsoft Visual Basic, C++, and C#.

The following sections provide information about using the control in various programming environments.
