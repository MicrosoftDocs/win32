# Make a Sketch

You do not need to do this, but it can be very helpful in getting your design to look the way you want it to. By planning ahead, you can save yourself having to move art around on multiple bitmap files.

Start up Photoshop and create a new image of the size required. Create a new layer to hold the rough sketch. If you have a sketch and a scanner, you might want to scan your sketch into Photoshop. The following illustration shows an example of a rough sketch.

The PlayPause button is at the upper left, the Stop, Next, and Prev buttons are at the left, the Volume trackbar is at the bottom, and the Marquee is between the PlayPause button and the Volume trackbar.

When creating a skin for Windows Media Player 10 Mobile or later, a PlayPauseStop button should be used instead of a PlayPause button. An additional Stop button is not needed.
