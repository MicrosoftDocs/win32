# Echo Sample Properties

The Echo sample exposes two properties: the delay time and the effect level (wet mix). The value for the dry signal level (dry mix) is always derived from the wet mix value. You need to modify existing code and add some new code to make these properties accessible.

The following sections explain how to modify the properties code:

-   [How Properties Work](how-properties-work.md)
-   [Variables to Store Properties](variables-to-store-properties.md)
-   [Modifying the Scale Property](modifying-the-scale-property.md)
-   [Adding the Wet Mix Property](adding-the-wet-mix-property.md)
