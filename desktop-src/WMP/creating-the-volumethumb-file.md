# Creating the VolumeThumb File

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The VolumeThumb file contains the thumb image that will be used with a Volume trackbar.

The following image is the VolumeThumb file.

This contains the two thumb images. The one on the left is the normal state, and the one on the right is the pushed state. There is no disabled state. If a trackbar is disabled, the disabled background image of the trackbar is displayed from the Super file.
