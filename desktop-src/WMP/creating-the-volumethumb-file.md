# Creating the VolumeThumb File

The VolumeThumb file contains the thumb image that will be used with a Volume trackbar.

The following image is the VolumeThumb file.

This contains the two thumb images. The one on the left is the normal state, and the one on the right is the pushed state. There is no disabled state. If a trackbar is disabled, the disabled background image of the trackbar is displayed from the Super file.
