# Writing the Code

You now have all the art files you need. All you need to do now is write some simple commands in the skin definition file.

The following sections guide you through the process of writing the code.

-   [Initial Lines](initial-lines.md)
-   [Description Section](description-section.md)
-   [Bitmaps Section](bitmaps-section.md)
-   [Buttons Section](buttons-section.md)
-   [Text Section](text-section.md)
-   [Marquee Section](marquee-section.md)
-   [Trackbars Section](trackbars-section.md)

For more information about the specifics of skin definition files, see the [Skin Reference](skin-reference.md).
