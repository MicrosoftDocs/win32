# Writing the Code

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

You now have all the art files you need. All you need to do now is write some simple commands in the skin definition file.

The following sections guide you through the process of writing the code.

-   [Initial Lines](initial-lines.md)
-   [Description Section](description-section.md)
-   [Bitmaps Section](bitmaps-section.md)
-   [Buttons Section](buttons-section.md)
-   [Text Section](text-section.md)
-   [Marquee Section](marquee-section.md)
-   [Trackbars Section](trackbars-section.md)

For more information about the specifics of skin definition files, see the [Skin Reference](skin-reference.md).
