# CLOSEBUTTON

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This is a predefined **BUTTON** with the following default values.


```C++
onclick="jscript:view.close();"
upToolTip="Close"

```



## Remarks

This creates a **BUTTON** control that closes the Player. The ToolTips are localized. All properties of this **BUTTON** can be overridden by explicitly specifying them.
