# Object Model Reference for C++

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

> [!Note]  
> Using the Windows Media Player ActiveX control with C++ is supported for Windows Media Player 9 Series or later.

 

The Object Model Reference for C++ provides documentation for Windows Media Player and Windows Media Player Mobile interfaces and enumeration types.

If you want to use remoting or skins with the Windows Media Player control, you'll also need to learn about the **IWMPPlayerServices** and **IWMPRemoteMediaServices** interfaces, which are designed to be used with C++.

For a demonstration of embedding the Windows Media Player control in a C++ program, see the C++ samples included with this SDK.

The following sections document the C++ interfaces and enumerations provided by the Windows Media Player object model.



| Section                                    | Description                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Interfaces](interfaces.md)               | Lists the interfaces and methods available to C++ programmers who use the Windows Media Player ActiveX control. |
| [Enumeration Types](enumeration-types.md) | Lists the enumeration types available in C++ code.                                                              |
