# DROPDOWNPLAYLIST

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This is a predefined **PLAYLIST** element with the following default values.

``` syntax
playlistItemsVisible="false"
```

## Remarks

This will create a simple dropdown **PLAYLIST** with no items displayed. All properties of this **PLAYLIST** can be overridden by explicitly specifying them.

## Requirements



| Requirement | Value |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Version<br/> | Windows Media Player 7.0 or later<br/> |
