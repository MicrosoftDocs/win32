# User Overview

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

To the user, visualizations are images that dance in time to the music. They provide additional entertainment to enhance musical experiences. The more entertaining a visualization is, the better!

A typical visualization appears as shown in the following illustration.

## Standard Visualizations

Windows Media Player includes several visualizations, such as the following:

-   Ambience
-   Plenoptic
-   Spike

## Standard Presets

In addition, each visualization comes with specific presets that alter how the visualization is displayed. For example, the Spike visualization comes in two presets:

-   Spike
-   Amoeba

Both effects are part of the same visualization, but have different presets. A preset is a set of values for the attributes of a particular visualization.

## Skin Attributes

If you create skins for Windows Media Player, you can display the standard visualizations in your skins using the **Effects** element. For more details on using visualizations in skins, see [Windows Media Player Skins](windows-media-player-skins.md).
