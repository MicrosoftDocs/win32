# WMP SDK Samples

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The Windows Media Player SDK includes a variety of samples that demonstrate many of the programming techniques described in this document.

-   Scripting samples demonstrate how to embed the Player ActiveX control in a webpage. A complete webpage sample demonstrates how to detect the current version of the Player ActiveX control.
-   A skins sample demonstrates how to change the visual appearance and the behavior of Windows Media Player.
-   A wizard for Microsoft Visual C++ can create a unique working sample of several types of plug-in: a visualization plug-in, a user interface plug-in, a rendering plug-in, and a digital signal processing plug-in.
-   Samples for online stores include a wizard for Microsoft Visual C++ that can create a unique working sample of an online store COM object.
-   Samples for Microsoft Visual C++ demonstrate embedding the Windows Media Player ActiveX control, remoting the Player ActiveX control, and working with the library.
-   A C# sample demonstrates using the Windows Media Player ActiveX control with the .NET Framework.
-   A Visual Basic .NET sample demonstrates using the Windows Media Player ActiveX control with the .NET Framework.

To use the samples, you must install the Windows SDK, which includes the Windows Media Player SDK. To download the Windows SDK, go to the [Windows SDK](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/bb980924.aspx) page in the Windows Developer Center.
