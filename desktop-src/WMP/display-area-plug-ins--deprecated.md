# Display Area Plug-ins (deprecated)

This page documents a feature that may be unavailable in future versions of Windows Media Player and the Windows Media Player SDK.

Display area UI plug-ins are shown in the main area of the **Now Playing** pane, below the artist and track information and to the left of the playlist area. Only one display area plug-in can be enabled at a time. When a display area plug-in is enabled, the Player cannot enter full screen mode.

Display area plug-ins are useful for displaying large amounts of information. For example, a display area plug-in can retrieve information about the currently playing media item and display related articles, interviews, and reviews. A display area plug-in can host a Microsoft Internet Explorer browser window to display this information using HTML.

> [!Note]  
> A hosted browser window can embed the ActiveX version of Windows Media Player, but this is not recommended because the embedded control cannot communicate with the standalone player that contains it.

 

> [!Note]  
> Windows Media Player closes any open display area plug-in when the user plays content that contains video.
