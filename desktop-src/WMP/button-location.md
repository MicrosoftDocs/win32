# Button Location

You must define the location for each Button image. To do this, you provide four positive integers separated by commas. The numbers define the coordinates of the top-left corner, the width, and height of a button, in pixels.

If you are using region buttons (PushHit, ToggleHit, and 2PushHit), you still must enter these four numbers. The values are used to determine the locations for the secondary images such as Pushed and Disabled.

> [!Note]  
> Button types are deprecated in skins for Windows Media Player 10 Mobile or later.
