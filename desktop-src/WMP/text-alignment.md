# Text Alignment

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

You must define the alignment of the text display box you want to use. The values shown in the following table are valid.



| Value  | Description                |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Left   | The text is left-aligned.  |
| Center | The text is centered.      |
| Right  | The text is right-aligned. |
