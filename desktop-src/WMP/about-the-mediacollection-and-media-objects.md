# About the MediaCollection and Media Objects

The **MediaCollection** and **Media** objects govern the media collection, which defines the locations of digital media files that Windows Media Player can access. You get the **MediaCollection** object from the **mediaCollection** property of the **Player** object. The **mediaCollection** property returns the **MediaCollection** object. You can only access the properties of the **MediaCollection** object after you have created it. For example, to add a **Media** object (a song), use the following code:


```C++
player.mediacollection.add('laure.wma');

```



You have added the file laure.wma to the media collection.

You can get the current **Media** object by using the **currentMedia** property of the **Player**. For example, this code gets the **duration** property of the current **Media** object:


```C++
myduration = player.currentmedia.duration;

```



There are many ways to get a **Media** object so that you can access its properties. For example, if you want to access the **duration** property of the current media, each of the following lines of code could be used.

To get the duration of the currently playing media:


```C++
player.currentMedia.duration;

```



To get the duration of the current media in a playlist:


```C++
player.controls.currentItem.duration;

```



To get the duration of the third media item in a playlist:


```C++
player.currentPlaylist.item(2).duration;

```



To get the duration of the third media item in a "Jazz" genre:


```C++
player.mediaCollection.getByGenre("jazz").item(2).duration;

```



To get the duration of the third media item in the second playlist:


```C++
player.playlistCollection.getAll.item(1).item(2).duration; 
```
