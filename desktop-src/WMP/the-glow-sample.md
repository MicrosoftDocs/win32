# The Glow Sample

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This section describes how to create a simple visualization called Glow. Three presets are used: Red, Green, and Blue. The Custom visualization wizard was run and the name Glow was chosen.

Glow simply changes color in time to the music. The glow flickers because the audio power of the waveform sometimes crosses zero at the moment of the snapshot. This sample is chosen because it is one of the simplest samples possible.

The following sections will guide you:

-   [Implementing Render](implementing-render-sample.md)
-   [Changing Presets](changing-presets.md)
