# The Glow Sample

This section describes how to create a simple visualization called Glow. Three presets are used: Red, Green, and Blue. The Custom visualization wizard was run and the name Glow was chosen.

Glow simply changes color in time to the music. The glow flickers because the audio power of the waveform sometimes crosses zero at the moment of the snapshot. This sample is chosen because it is one of the simplest samples possible.

The following sections will guide you:

-   [Changing Presets](changing-presets.md)
