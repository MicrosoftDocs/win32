# Alternate Images

Alternate images are images that are not seen when the skin is initially displayed, but become visible in response to mouse events. For example, you can set up the skin so that when a mouse hovers over a specific area, the art in that area will change. This can inform users visually that they can click on an area to do something. You might also use an alternate image when the user clicks on an area to give them visual feedback that the click was received by Windows Media Player.
