# Other Skin Samples

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

To see samples of complete working skins, click the **Start** button, then point to **Programs**, then **Windows Media**, then **Windows Media SDK**, and then click **Player SDK samples**. You must first install the Windows Media Player SDK to use the samples.
