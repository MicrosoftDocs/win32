# Separate Window Plug-ins

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Separate window UI plug-ins are shown in their own windows. These windows can be fixed in size or can be made resizable. Multiple separate UI plug-in windows can be open at the same time.

Separate window UI plug-ins are useful when you want the information or controls you provide to remain visible when the user switches out of the **Now Playing** pane or loads another UI plug-in. Any separate window UI plug-ins that are running when Windows Media Player is closed will be reloaded and displayed in the same size and position when the player is started again.
