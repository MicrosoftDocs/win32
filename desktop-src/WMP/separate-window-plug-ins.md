# Separate Window Plug-ins

Separate window UI plug-ins are shown in their own windows. These windows can be fixed in size or can be made resizable. Multiple separate UI plug-in windows can be open at the same time.

Separate window UI plug-ins are useful when you want the information or controls you provide to remain visible when the user switches out of the **Now Playing** pane or loads another UI plug-in. Any separate window UI plug-ins that are running when Windows Media Player is closed will be reloaded and displayed in the same size and position when the player is started again.
