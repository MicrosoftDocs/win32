# Using ASP Pages to Dynamically Create Windows Media Metafile Playlists

You can use Active Server Pages (ASP, or .asp files) to dynamically generate playlists based on information provided by users. An ASP page is a dynamic webpage used in conjunction with Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). ASP is an environment in which you can combine HTML, scripts, and reusable ActiveX server components to create dynamic and powerful Web-based business solutions. ASP pages enable server-side scripting for IIS with native support for both Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) and Microsoft JScript. This discussion assumes that you are familiar with ASP and defining variables.

All header information must be contained on the first line of the ASP page string returned to Windows Media Player.

When you use ASP pages to generate playlists, you must specify values for the **Response** object's **ContentType** and **expires** properties in the ASP page because of latency issues with Windows Media Player. The **Response.ContentType** value must be a valid file name extension for Windows Media metafiles. Acceptable values include wma, wax, wmv, wvx, asf, and asx.

The **Response.expires** property specifies the length of time, in seconds, that Windows Media Player caches the playlist file. Specifying a value of zero results in Windows Media Player requesting a new playlist from the server each time the user refreshes the page.

See the Platform SDK for details about using the **Response** object in Active Server Pages.

The following code is an example of an ASP page used to generate a Windows Media metafile playlist.


```XML
<%Response.ContentType = "video/x-ms-wma"%><%Response.expires=0 %>
<ASX VERSION="3.0">
    <TITLE>Your title here</TITLE>
    <ENTRY>
        <REF HREF ="mms://adventure-works.com/pubpt/filename.wma" />
    </ENTRY>
</ASX>

```
