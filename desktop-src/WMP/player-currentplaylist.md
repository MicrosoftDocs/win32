# Player.currentPlaylist

The currentPlaylist property specifies or retrieves the current **Playlist** object.

## Syntax

*player* .**currentPlaylist**

## Possible Values

This property is a read/write **Playlist** object.

## Remarks

If the *Settings*.**autoStart** property is true, playback begins automatically whenever you set **currentPlaylist**.

This property takes a Playlist object, which can be acquired in several ways, such as by calling *PlaylistArray*.**item** or *PlaylistCollection*.**newPlaylist**. To load a **Playlist** item using a file name, set the URL property or use *Player*.**newPlaylist**.

## Examples

The following JScript example retrieves the first playlist in the library. It then uses **currentPlaylist** to make the retrieved playlist the current playlist, and then to display the name of the current playlist. The **Player** object was created with ID = "Player".


```JScript
// Retrieve the first playlist from the library.
var firstPL = Player.playlistCollection.getAll().item(0);

// Make the retrieved playlist the current playlist.
Player.currentPlaylist = firstPL;

// Display the name of the current playlist.
document.write("Found first playlist. Name: " + Player.currentPlaylist.name);
```
