# URL Flipping

Using webpages for slide shows is called URL flipping, and is handled automatically by Windows Media Player when it encounters URL script commands embedded in the digital media stream it is playing. You can specify a target frame for your pages in each script command, or you can specify it by setting the **Settings.defaultFrame** property. You can set this property in script code or by using a PARAM element within the OBJECT element that embeds the Windows Media Player control.

You are free to handle the URL script commands in your JScript code just as you would handle custom script commands. If you want the Windows Media Player control to ignore URL script commands so that you can handle them entirely by yourself, set the *Settings*.**invokeURLs** property to false either in script code or using a PARAM element as previously described.

The following example illustrates a typical frameset for URL flipping. First, create a page that describes the frameset:


```HTML
<HTML>
<FRAMESET cols="300,*">
  <FRAME name="player" src="player.html">
  <FRAME name="content">
</FRAMESET>
</HTML>

```



Next, create the player.html file referenced in the frameset by using the following code (the video.wmv file is assumed to exist in the same directory as the HTML files):


```HTML
<HTML>
<BODY>
<OBJECT ID="Player" CLASSID="CLSID:6BF52A52-394A-11d3-B153-00C04F79FAA6">
  <PARAM name="URL" value="https://www.proseware.com/Media/video.wmv"/>
  <PARAM name="defaultFrame" value="content"/>
</OBJECT>
</BODY>
</HTML>

```



If your webpages are small enough to load rapidly, this setup may be sufficient for your needs. If, on the other hand, your webpages are complex, rich media streaming may be more effective depending on the connection speed of your audience.

> [!Note]  
> URL flipping does not work correctly with pages viewed in Netscape Navigator. Instead of appearing in the frame specified by **defaultFrame**, each URL script command received in Navigator displays the URL in a new browser window.
