# Required Interfaces (Windows Media Player SDK)

Windows Media Player renders audio and video by using one of the following pipelines.

-   DirectShow
-   Media Foundation

In Microsoft Windows XP and earlier, the Player uses DirectShow. In Windows Vista, the Player sometimes uses DirectShow and sometimes uses Media Foundation.

A DSP plug-in implements some or all of the following interfaces:

-   **IMediaObject**
-   **IWMPPluginEnable**
-   **IMFTransform**
-   **IMFGetService**
-   **ISpecifyPropertyPages**

A plug-in that implements **IMediaObject** and **IWMPPluginEnable** can run in the DirectShow pipeline. It can also run in the Media Foundation Pipeline inside a wrapper provided by Media Foundation. A plug-in of this type is called a Microsoft DirectX Media Object (DMO). It is common to think of a DMO as being analogous to a filter object in DirectShow. The DMO documentation is in the DirectShow section of the Windows SDK.

A plug-in that implements **IMFTransform** and **IMFGetService** can run natively (no wrapper required) in the Media Foundation pipeline. A plug-in of this type is called a Media Foundation Transform (MFT). The MFT documentation is in the Media Foundation section of the Windows SDK.

A plug-in that implements **IMediaObject**, **IWMPPluginEnable**, **IMFTransform**, and **IMFGetService** can run in the DirectShow pipeline and can also run natively in the Media Foundation pipeline. This type of plug-in, which is called a *dual-mode DSP plug-in*, can play the role of a DMO or an MFT.

When Windows Media Player uses a dual-mode DSP plug-in in the Media Foundation pipeline, it first queries for the **IMFTransform** interface. If that query fails, Windows Media Player queries for the **IMediaObject** interface. If the **IMediaObject** query is successful, the plug-in is wrapped and added to the Media Foundation pipeline.

Regardless of the pipeline, any DSP plug-in that allows the user to set properties must implement **ISpecifyPropertyPages**.
