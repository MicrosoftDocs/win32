# Building the Plug-in for a Type 2 Online Store

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

You can create a type 2 online store plug-in by using the online store plug-in wizard. The project wizard is included with the Windows Media Player SDK, which is part of the Windows SDK. The wizard is an add-in for Microsoft Visual Studio that creates a C++ project and generates sample code that you can use as a starting point for developing your own online store.

The following topics explain how to use the online store plug-in wizard:

-   [Installing the Project Wizard](installing-the-project-wizard.md)
-   [Creating a Sample Project](creating-a-sample-project.md)
-   [Compiling the Sample Project](compiling-the-sample-project.md)
-   [Running the Sample Project](running-the-sample-project.md)
-   [Customizing the Sample Project](customizing-the-sample-project.md)
