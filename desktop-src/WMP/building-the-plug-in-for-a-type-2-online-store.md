# Building the Plug-in for a Type 2 Online Store

You can create a type 2 online store plug-in by using the online store plug-in wizard. The project wizard is included with the Windows Media Player SDK, which is part of the Windows SDK. The wizard is an add-in for Microsoft Visual Studio that creates a C++ project and generates sample code that you can use as a starting point for developing your own online store.

The following topics explain how to use the online store plug-in wizard:
