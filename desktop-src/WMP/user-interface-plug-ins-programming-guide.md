# User Interface Plug-ins Programming Guide

The two code samples described in this section demonstrate the process of implementing a custom user interface (UI) plug-in starting with code generated by the Windows Media Player Plug-in Wizard.

The Search UI plug-in is a metadata area plug-in that provides a **Search** button. When this button is clicked, a search page is launched in the default Web browser that contains information about the artist of the current media item.

The first step in creating this plug-in is to start a new project in Microsoft Visual C++ by selecting **Windows Media Player Plug-in Wizard** from the **Projects** tab. Name the project "Search", and click **OK**. Choose **UI Plug-in** and click **Next**. Then choose the Metadata type from the options list and click **Next**. Finally, click the check box for auto-run support so that the plug-in will load automatically, and then click **Finish**. The wizard generates the required project files, including basic implementations of the CSearch class and the **IWMPPluginUI** interface that it supports, and the CPluginWindow class that provides the UI. This is the code that will be modified to provide the plug-in functionality described in this section.

The last topic in this section describes how to create a background UI plug-in for Windows Media Player 10 Mobile. This plug-in uses modified code generated from the Windows Media Player Plug-in Wizard to create a plug-in for Windows Media Player 10 Mobile.

This section contains the following topics.
