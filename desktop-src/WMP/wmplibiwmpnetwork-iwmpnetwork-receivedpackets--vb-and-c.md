# IWMPNetwork::receivedPackets property

The **receivedPackets** property gets the number of packets received.

## Syntax


```CSharp
public System.Int32 receivedPackets {get; set;}
```


```VB

Public ReadOnly Property receivedPackets As System.Int32
```





## Property value

A **System.Int32** that is the number of packets received.

## Remarks

Each time playback is stopped and restarted, this property is reset to zero. The value is not reset if playback is paused.

## Examples

The following example uses **receivedPackets** to display the number of packets received. The information is displayed in a label in response to the **PlayStateChange** Event. The example uses a timer with a 1-second interval to update the display. The **AxWMPLib.AxWindowsMediaPlayer** object is represented by the variable named player.


```CSharp
// Add a delegate for the PlayStateChange event.
player.PlayStateChange += new AxWMPLib._WMPOCXEvents_PlayStateChangeEventHandler(player_PlayStateChange);

// Create an event handler for the PlayStateChange event.
private void player_PlayStateChange(object sender, AxWMPLib._WMPOCXEvents_PlayStateChangeEvent e)
{
    // Test whether packets may be arriving.
    switch (e.newState)
    {
        // If WMPPlayState is Stopped, Paused, ScanForward, ScanReverse, Waiting, MediaEnded
        // or Transitioning then stop the timer. 
        case 1: 
        case 2: 
        case 4: 
        case 5: 
        case 7: 
        case 8: 
        case 9: 
            timer.Stop();
            break;

        // If WMPPlayState is Playing or Buffering then set the timer interval and start the timer.
        default:
            timer.Interval = 1000;
            timer.Start();
            break;
    }
}

private void UpdateReceivedPackets(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    receivedPacketsLabel.Text = ("Packets received: " + player.network.receivedPackets.ToString());
}
```


```VB

' Create an event handler for the PlayStateChange event.
Public Sub player_PlayStateChange(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As AxWMPLib._WMPOCXEvents_PlayStateChangeEvent) Handles player.PlayStateChange

    &#39; Test whether packets may be arriving.
    Select Case e.newState

    &#39; If WMPPlayState is Stopped, Paused, ScanForward, ScanReverse, Waiting, MediaEnded
    &#39; or Transitioning then stop the timer. 
        Case 1
        Case 2
        Case 4
        Case 5
        Case 7
        Case 8
        Case 9
            timer.Stop()

        &#39; If WMPPlayState is Playing or Buffering then set the timer interval and start the timer.
        Case Else
            timer.Interval = 1000
            timer.Start()

    End Select

End Sub

Public Sub UpdateReceivedPackets(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles timer.Tick

    receivedPacketsLabel.Text = (&quot;Packets received: &quot; + player.network.receivedPackets.ToString())

End Sub
```
