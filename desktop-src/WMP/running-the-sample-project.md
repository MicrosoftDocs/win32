# Running the Sample Project

The sample COM component demonstrates the functionality provided by the methods of **IWMPSubscriptionServices** by displaying a dialog box whenever Windows Media Player calls one of the methods. To see this happen, you must first add some content to the library that contains a **ContentDistributor** attribute that matches your service. See [Adding the ContentDistributor Attribute](adding-the-contentdistributor-attribute.md). Then, use Windows Media Player 10 or later to open your online store, play your premium content, and copy your premium content to a device. Windows Media Player will instantiate the sample COM component and call methods when appropriate.
