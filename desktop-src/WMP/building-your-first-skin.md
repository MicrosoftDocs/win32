# Building Your First Skin

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

As explained in greater detail in [About Skins](about-skins.md), a skin is defined in a skin definition file, and requires one or more supporting art files, Microsoft JScript files, and digital media files. This tutorial for a very simple skin requires only the skin definition file and three art files. You will go through four steps described in the following topics:

-   [Creating the Primary Art File](creating-the-primary-art-file.md)
-   [Creating the Mapping File](creating-the-mapping-file.md)
-   [Creating the Hover Image](creating-the-hover-image.md)
-   [Creating the Skin Definition File](creating-the-skin-definition-file.md)
