# Building Your First Skin

As explained in greater detail in [About Skins](about-skins.md), a skin is defined in a skin definition file, and requires one or more supporting art files, Microsoft JScript files, and digital media files. This tutorial for a very simple skin requires only the skin definition file and three art files. You will go through four steps described in the following topics:

-   [Creating the Primary Art File](creating-the-primary-art-file.md)
-   [Creating the Mapping File](creating-the-mapping-file.md)
-   [Creating the Hover Image](creating-the-hover-image.md)
-   [Creating the Skin Definition File](creating-the-skin-definition-file.md)
