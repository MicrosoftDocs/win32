# Windows Media Player Object Model

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The Microsoft Windows Media Player ActiveX control object model provides interfaces that let developers add Windows Media Player and Windows Media Player Mobile functionality to webpages and other programs. The Windows Media Player ActiveX control object model documentation is presented in the following sections.

> [!Note]  
> The Windows Media Player Mobile ActiveX control is based on the Windows Media Player ActiveX control and therefore utilizes the same object model. So, unless otherwise noted, any documentation about embedding the Windows Media Player ActiveX control in a webpage or an application is also applicable to the Windows Media Player Mobile ActiveX control.
