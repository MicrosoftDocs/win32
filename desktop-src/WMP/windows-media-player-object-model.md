# Windows Media Player Object Model

The Microsoft Windows Media Player ActiveX control object model provides interfaces that let developers add Windows Media Player and Windows Media Player Mobile functionality to webpages and other programs. The Windows Media Player ActiveX control object model documentation is presented in the following sections.

> [!Note]  
> The Windows Media Player Mobile ActiveX control is based on the Windows Media Player ActiveX control and therefore utilizes the same object model. So, unless otherwise noted, any documentation about embedding the Windows Media Player ActiveX control in a webpage or an application is also applicable to the Windows Media Player Mobile ActiveX control.
