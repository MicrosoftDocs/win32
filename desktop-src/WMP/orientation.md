# Orientation

Some Windows Mobile-based devices can be used in different physical orientations. Available orientations include:

-   **Portrait**. The device is held in a vertical fashion so that it is taller than it is wide.
-   **Landscape**. The device is held in a horizontal fashion so that it is wider than it is tall.
-   **Square**. Some devices have a square-shaped display, which means there is a single orientation mode.

Each skin you create must specify a single orientation. You must provide a separate skin for each orientation. The skin chooser will only display skins that were created for the current orientation and dimensions of the device display.
