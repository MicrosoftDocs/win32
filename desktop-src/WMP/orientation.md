# Orientation

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Some Windows Mobile-based devices can be used in different physical orientations. Available orientations include:

-   **Portrait**. The device is held in a vertical fashion so that it is taller than it is wide.
-   **Landscape**. The device is held in a horizontal fashion so that it is wider than it is tall.
-   **Square**. Some devices have a square-shaped display, which means there is a single orientation mode.

Each skin you create must specify a single orientation. You must provide a separate skin for each orientation. The skin chooser will only display skins that were created for the current orientation and dimensions of the device display.
