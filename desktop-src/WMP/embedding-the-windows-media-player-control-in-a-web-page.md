# Embedding the Windows Media Player Control in a Web Page

When you embed the Windows Media Player control in a webpage, you can take a basic approach or a more elaborate approach.

In the basic approach, you use the control simply to play background music or to add a video display to your page.

In the more elaborate approach, you make your page interactive by adding script code to manipulate the control through the Player object model. This lets you provide a user interface of your own design or respond dynamically to script commands or events such as media transitions.
