# Embedding the Windows Media Player Control in a Web Page

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

When you embed the Windows Media Player control in a webpage, you can take a basic approach or a more elaborate approach.

In the basic approach, you use the control simply to play background music or to add a video display to your page.

In the more elaborate approach, you make your page interactive by adding script code to manipulate the control through the Player object model. This lets you provide a user interface of your own design or respond dynamically to script commands or events such as media transitions.
