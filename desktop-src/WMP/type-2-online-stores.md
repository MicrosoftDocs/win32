# Type 2 Online Stores

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

> [!Note]  
> This section describes functionality designed for use by online stores. Use of this functionality outside the context of an online store is not supported.

 

Windows Media Player 11 supports type 1 and type 2 online stores. Type 1 stores are more deeply integrated into the Player's user interface than type 2 stores. Windows Media Player 10 supports type 2 stores, but not type 1 stores. This documentation, which applies only to type 2 stores, is divided into the following sections.
