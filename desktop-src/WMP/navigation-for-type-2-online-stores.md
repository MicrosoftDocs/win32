# Navigation for Type 2 Online Stores

Web pages hosted by Windows Media Player 10 or later, such as those in online store service task panes, can use the [External.NavigateTaskPaneURL](external-navigatetaskpaneurl.md) method to control navigation within Windows Media Player. Navigation can occur in the following ways:

-   Between service task panes. See [Navigating between Service Task Panes](navigating-between-service-task-panes.md)
-   From features like Info Center View, HTMLView webpages, and the album information page to service task panes. See [Navigating from Windows Media Player Features](navigating-from-windows-media-player-features.md).
-   Between online stores. See [Navigating to Other Online Stores](navigating-to-other-online-stores.md).
