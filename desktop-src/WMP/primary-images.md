# Primary Images

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

You will want to create primary images for your skin. The primary image is composed of one background image defined by the **VIEW** element, and any other images that go with specific elements. For example, if you create a **BUTTON** element, you must include the art for that button, and be sure that it has a higher z-order than the background image.
