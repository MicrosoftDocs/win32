# Primary Images

You will want to create primary images for your skin. The primary image is composed of one background image defined by the **VIEW** element, and any other images that go with specific elements. For example, if you create a **BUTTON** element, you must include the art for that button, and be sure that it has a higher z-order than the background image.
