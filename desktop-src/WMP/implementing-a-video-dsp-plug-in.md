# Implementing a Video DSP Plug-in

Computer video display adapters support a set of video formats. Digital video codecs also support a set of video formats. When attempting to play a particular video file, Windows Media Player must choose a format to use for rendering. The Player attempts to find the best match between the formats supported by the video codec and the formats supported by the video display adapter—that is, the one that yields the highest quality.

To create a Windows Media Player DSP plug-in that processes video, you'll first need to decide which video formats you'd like your plug-in to process. The sample video DSP plug-in works with the following video formats:

-   NV12
-   YV12
-   YUY2
-   UYVY
-   RGB32
-   RGB24
-   RGB555
-   RGB565

Which formats you choose to process is up to you. You can remove formats from the sample plug-in so that they aren't supported any longer and you can add code to process additional formats.

The following sections provide additional information you should know before creating your own video DSP plug-in for Windows Media Player:
