# VIEW Element

The **VIEW** element contains the user interface details of a skin, and uses the attributes, methods, and event handlers shown in the following tables.

Multiple **VIEW** elements can be defined as children of the **THEME** element of a skin to provide different interfaces for different situations. **VIEW** elements cannot be specified as children of any other element, and they contain all other skin elements. Note that each view has its own variable scope, which means it cannot share attribute values with other views.

The **view** global attribute can be used to reference a specific **VIEW** element from anywhere within it. This is an alternative to using its **id** attribute, which must be used from within other **VIEW** elements or from within the **THEME** element.

The **VIEW** element supports the following attributes. Attributes marked with an asterisk (\*) are also supported by the **SUBVIEW** element.
