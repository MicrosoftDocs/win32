# About Allocating Streaming Resources

The sample DSP plug-in generated by the Windows Media Player Plug-in Wizard does not require any additional streaming buffers. However, you might want to allocate memory resources for your DSP plug-in. For example, a plug-in that produces an echo effect would require a secondary buffer to create the necessary time delay.

The **IMediaObject** interface contains two methods to handle this situation. Windows Media Player calls **IMediaObject::AllocateStreamingResources** to give you an opportunity to create any buffers you require. Windows Media Player later calls **IMediaObject::FreeStreamingResources** to allow you to free any memory you allocated previously. The sample DSP plug-in implementation also calls **FreeStreamingResources** from *CProjectName*::**FinalRelease** to ensure that all resources are freed before the plug-in object is destroyed.
