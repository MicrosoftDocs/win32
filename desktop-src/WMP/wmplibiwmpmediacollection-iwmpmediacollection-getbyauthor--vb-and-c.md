# IWMPMediaCollection::getByAuthor method

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `getByAuthor` method returns an **IWMPPlaylist** interface that provides access to the media items by the specified author.

## Syntax


```CSharp
public IWMPPlaylist getByAuthor(
  System.String bstrAuthor
);
```


```VB

Public Function getByAuthor( _
  ByVal bstrAuthor As System.String _
) As IWMPPlaylist
Implements IWMPMediaCollection.getByAuthor
```





## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*bstrAuthor* \[in\]
</dt> <dd>

The **System.String** that is the name of the author.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

A **WMPLib.IWMPPlaylist** interface for the retrieved media items.

## Remarks

Before calling this method, you must have read access to the library. For more information, see [Library Access](library-access.md).

There are two ways you ways you can retrieve an **IWMPMediaCollection** interface, and the behavior of the `getByAuthor` method depends on which of those two ways you use. If you retrieve the interface by calling [AxWindowsMediaPlayer.mediaCollection](axwmplib-axwindowsmediaplayer-mediacollection--vb-and-c.md), then the `getByAuthor` method returns all the media items in the library. However, if you retrieve the interface by calling [IWMPLibrary.mediaCollection](wmplibiwmplibrary-iwmplibrary-mediacollection--vb-and-c.md), then the `getByAuthor` method returns only the audio items in the library that have the specified attribute and value.

## Examples

The following example uses `getByAuthor` to create a playlist of media items when the user clicks a button. The playlist contains items matching the author's name specified by the user in a text box. The **AxWMPLib.AxWindowsMediaPlayer** object is represented by the variable named player.


```CSharp
private void playAuthor_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{ 
    // ...Add code to ensure that the text box contains a valid value.
 
    // Retrieve the author's name from the text box. 
    string author = getAuthor.Text;

    // Create the playlist using getByAuthor. 
    WMPLib.IWMPPlaylist pl = player.mediaCollection.getByAuthor(author);

    // Make the new playlist the current playlist. 
    player.currentPlaylist = pl;

    // Play the media in the current playlist. 
    player.Ctlcontrols.play();
}
```


```VB

Public Sub playAuthor_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles playAuthor.Click

    &#39; ...Add code to ensure that the text box contains a valid value.

    &#39; Retrieve the author&#39;s name from the text box. 
    Dim author As String = getAuthor.Text

    &#39; Create the playlist using getByAuthor. 
    Dim pl As WMPLib.IWMPPlaylist = player.mediaCollection.getByAuthor(author)

    &#39; Make the new playlist the current playlist. 
    player.currentPlaylist = pl

    &#39; Play the media in the current playlist. 
    player.Ctlcontrols.play()

End Sub
```
