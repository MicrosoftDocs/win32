# Building a DSP Plug-in

You can build a DSP plug-in by using Visual Studio and the Windows Media Player plug-in wizard. For information on setting up the wizard and building a plug-in, see [Building a Plug-in](building-a-plug-in.md).

When you run the wizard, you will be given a choice of several different types of plug-ins. Choose **DSP Plug-in**.

The following topics describe the features of the sample audio and video DSP plug-ins that you can build by using the wizard.
