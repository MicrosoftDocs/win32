# Building a DSP Plug-in

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

You can build a DSP plug-in by using Visual Studio and the Windows Media Player plug-in wizard. For information on setting up the wizard and building a plug-in, see [Building a Plug-in](building-a-plug-in.md).

When you run the wizard, you will be given a choice of several different types of plug-ins. Choose **DSP Plug-in**.

The following topics describe the features of the sample audio and video DSP plug-ins that you can build by using the wizard.
