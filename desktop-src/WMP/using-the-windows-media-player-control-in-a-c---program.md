# Using the Windows Media Player Control in a C++ Program

> [!Note]  
> Using C++ to embed the Windows Media Player control is supported for Windows Media Player 9 Series or later.

 

There are several different ways to use the Windows Media Player control in a C++ program. You can create an instance of the control in a console application, or you can embed the control in a Windows application. Also, you can implement interfaces that enable you to run an embedded Player control in remote mode. You can customize the user interface of an embedded control by applying a skin definition file.

This information is described in the following topics.

> [!Note]  
> You can embed the Windows Media Player 10 Mobile control in a Windows CE application. The techniques you use to do this are similar to those used with the desktop Windows Media Player control. However, there are differences between ATL for Windows and ATL for Windows CE. This documentation describes the differences between these implementations, where appropriate.
