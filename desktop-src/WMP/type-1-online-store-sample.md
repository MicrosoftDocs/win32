# Type 1 Online Store Sample

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The Windows Media Player SDK includes a sample type 1 online store that is supported by Windows Media Player 11.

To view the sample type 1 online store, configure your registry as described in [Registry Keys and Entries for a Type 1 Online Store](registry-keys-and-entries-for-a-type-1-online-store.md). The key for the sample type 1 store is 2573.
