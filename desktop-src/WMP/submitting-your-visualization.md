# Submitting Your Visualization

Submitting your visualization through the WMPlugins website is no longer supported.

## Test Your Visualization

You may want to try installing your visualization on several machines to be sure that everything works the way you want. Try every preset to make sure your code works correctly.

## Sign Your Visualization

You must submit your visualization for code signing so that the user can decide whether to trust your visualization before they install it. For information about code signing, see [Introduction to Code Signing](/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/ms537361(v=vs.85)).

## Distributing Your Visualization

Although the WMPlugins website no longer supports distribution of your visualization, you can still distribute your visualization from a website of your choosing.
