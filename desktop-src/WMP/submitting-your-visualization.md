# Submitting Your Visualization

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Submitting your visualization through the WMPlugins website is no longer supported.

## Test Your Visualization

You may want to try installing your visualization on several machines to be sure that everything works the way you want. Try every preset to make sure your code works correctly.

## Sign Your Visualization

You must submit your visualization for code signing so that the user can decide whether to trust your visualization before they install it. For information about code signing, see [Introduction to Code Signing](/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/ms537361(v=vs.85)).

## Distributing Your Visualization

Although the WMPlugins website no longer supports distribution of your visualization, you can still distribute your visualization from a website of your choosing.
