# About DSP Plug-ins

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Microsoft Windows Media Player provides architecture for connecting add-on software that performs digital signal processing (DSP) functions on the audio or video streams during playback. These add-on programs are referred to as DSP plug-ins.

The following sections provide a conceptual overview of Windows Media Player DSP plug-ins.
