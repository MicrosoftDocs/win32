# Implementing Your DSP Code

Once you have built the sample DSP plug-in, you can modify the code to create your own Windows Media Player DSP plug-in. Which methods you change and which you can leave as they are depends upon the following factors:

-   The number of properties you want to allow the user to change. You will certainly want to change the default property page implementation to suit your needs, and you may need to add additional properties.
-   Whether your DSP plug-in needs to allocate any streaming resources. Your plug-in may require additional buffers.
-   Whether your audio DSP plug-in needs to continue to output data after Windows Media Player has stopped supplying data in the input buffer.

The following sections use the DSP plug-in sample code generated by the Windows Media Player Plug-in Wizard to illustrate important concepts. You might find it helpful to open Microsoft Visual Studio and generate the sample code first so you can refer to it as you read this section. For details about how to use the Windows Media Player Plug-in Wizard, see [Building a DSP Plug-in](building-a-dsp-plug-in.md).
