# Cdrom.playlist

The **playlist** property retrieves a **Playlist** object representing the tracks on the CD currently in the CD drive or the root-level title entries for DVD.

``` syntax
player.cdromCollection.item(
        index
        ).playlist
      
```

## Possible Values

This property is a read-only **Playlist** object.

## Remarks

Typically, DVDs are organized into titles. Each title contains one or more chapters. Each DVD is authored differently, so how titles and chapters are used is up to the content author.

For DVD, this method retrieves a playlist that contains as the first item a **Media** object that represents the DVD media. Playing the item results in the DVD playing from the beginning if it is the first play after inserting a new DVD, or resuming playback if the DVD is the same as the last DVD viewed. Setting this item as the current one during playback results in the DVD playing from the beginning.

Additional items (**Media** objects) in the playlist are DVD titles that are represented by nested playlists. When you specify *Controls*.**currentItem** to equal one of these nested playlist items, Windows Media Player automatically sets the nested playlist as *Player*.**currentPlaylist** after chapter playback begins. You can then use the **currentPlaylist** object properties, methods, and events to work with DVD chapters, which are also playlist items.

To retrieve the value of this property, read access to the library is required. For more information, see [Library Access](library-access.md).

**Windows Media Player 10 Mobile:** This property is not supported.

## Examples

The following example uses *Cdrom*.**playlist** to fill an HTML text element, named myText, with the titles of the audio CD currently in the first CD drive. Use *CdromCollection*.**count** to determine the number of available CD drives. The **Player** object was created with ID = "Player".


```
// Store the CD playlist object.
var pl = Player.cdromCollection.Item(0).Playlist;

// Iterate through the CD track list.
for(var i = 0; i < pl.count; i++){

   // Print each CD track name.
   myText.value += pl.Item(i).name + "\n"; 
}
```
