# Settings Area Plug-ins

For Microsoft Windows Media Player 11 and earlier, settings area UI plug-ins are shown in the Tools area of the **Now Playing** pane below the main display area and above the transport controls. For Microsoft Windows Media Player 12 and later, settings area UI plug-ins appear as separate windows. Only one settings area plug-in can be enabled at a time.

Settings area plug-ins are useful for displaying custom control panels similar to the graphic equalizer or video settings controls.
