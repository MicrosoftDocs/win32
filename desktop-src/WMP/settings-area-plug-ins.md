# Settings Area Plug-ins

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

For Microsoft Windows Media Player 11 and earlier, settings area UI plug-ins are shown in the Tools area of the **Now Playing** pane below the main display area and above the transport controls. For Microsoft Windows Media Player 12 and later, settings area UI plug-ins appear as separate windows. Only one settings area plug-in can be enabled at a time.

Settings area plug-ins are useful for displaying custom control panels similar to the graphic equalizer or video settings controls.
