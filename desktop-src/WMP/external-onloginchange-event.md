# External.OnLoginChange Event

> [!Note]  
> This topic describes functionality designed for use by online stores. Use of this functionality outside the context of an online store is not supported.

 

The **OnLoginChange** event occurs when the user's log-in status changes or when an attempt to log in fails.

``` syntax
window.external.OnLoginChange = FunctionName
```

## Possible Values

This is a write-only property that specifies the name of the function in script that Windows Media Player calls when the event occurs.

## Parameters

The function that handles this event takes no parameters.

## Remarks

This event occurs every time the online store's plug-in calls [IWMPContentPartnerCallback::Notify](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/contentpartner/nf-contentpartner-iwmpcontentpartnercallback-notify), passing wmpcnLoginStateChange in the *type* parameter. Sometimes the plug-in makes this call to notify Windows Media Player that there was a change in the user's log-in state. Other times, the plug-in makes this call to notify the Player that an attempt to log in failed. The *pContext* parameter of the **Notify** method specifies whether the notification is for a change of log-in state or for a failed log-in attempt.

Because every call to `Notify(wmpcnLoginStateChange, ...)` causes Windows Media Player to raise the **OnLoginChange** event, the **OnLoginChange** event handler is called sometimes as the result of a change in log-in state and sometimes as the result of a failed log-in attempt. To determine the user's current log-in state, the **OnLoginChange** event handler must call [External.userLoggedIn](external-userloggedin.md).
