# IWMPNetwork::bitRate property

The **bitRate** property gets the current bit rate being received.

## Syntax


```CSharp
public System.Int32 bitRate {get; set;}
```


```VB

Public ReadOnly Property bitRate As System.Int32
```





## Property value

A **System.Int32** that is the bit rate.

## Remarks

The value of this property is a combination of the bit rates of both video and audio streams.

## Examples

The following example uses **bitRate** to display the current media bit rate. The information is displayed in a label in response to the **PlayStateChange** Event. The **AxWMPLib.AxWindowsMediaPlayer** object is represented by the variable named player.


```CSharp
// Add a delegate for the PlayStateChange event.
player.PlayStateChange += new AxWMPLib._WMPOCXEvents_PlayStateChangeEventHandler(player_PlayStateChange);

// Create an event handler for the PlayStateChange event.
private void player_PlayStateChange(object sender, AxWMPLib._WMPOCXEvents_PlayStateChangeEvent e)
{
    // Display the bitRate when the player is playing. 
    switch (e.newState)
    {
        case 3:  // Play State = WMPLib.WMPPlayState.wmppsPlaying = 3
            if (player.network.bitRate != 0)
            {
                bitRateLabel.Text = "Current Bit Rate: " + player.network.bitRate + " K bits/second";
            }
            break;

        default:
            break;
    }
}
```


```VB

' Create an event handler for the PlayStateChange event.
Public Sub player_PlayStateChange(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As AxWMPLib._WMPOCXEvents_PlayStateChangeEvent) Handles player.PlayStateChange

    &#39; Display the bitRate when the player is playing. 
    Select Case e.newState

        Case 3 &#39; Play State = WMPLib.WMPPlayState.wmppsPlaying = 3

            If (player.network.bitRate <> 0) Then

                bitRateLabel.Text = &quot;Current Bit Rate: &quot; + player.network.bitRate + &quot; K bits/second&quot;

            End If

    End Select

End Sub
```
