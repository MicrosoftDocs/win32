# Music File Attributes

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The following attributes are available for a music file not in the library. These attributes correspond to inputs found in the Windows Media Player **Advanced Tag Editor** dialog box.

-   [Description Attribute](description-attribute.md)
-   [WM/OriginalAlbumTitle Attribute](wm-originalalbumtitle-attribute.md)
-   [WM/OriginalArtist Attribute](wm-originalartist-attribute.md)
-   [WM/OriginalLyricist Attribute](wm-originallyricist-attribute.md)
-   [WM/PartOfSet Attribute](wm-partofset-attribute.md)
