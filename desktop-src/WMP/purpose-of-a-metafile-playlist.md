# Purpose of a Metafile Playlist

The basic purpose of a metafile playlist is to redirect streaming media content away from browsers to Windows Media Player because most browsers will attempt to download the content instead of stream it. A metafile playlist provides information Windows Media Player uses to receive streams, such as the Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The metafile playlist can provide the path to media files over the Internet, an intranet or just stored media on a network or local drive. With processing redirected to Windows Media Player, you have greater control over the streaming media.

Metafile playlists are used to control the streaming experience. By combining different media files into a single content stream, you can control and customize their presentation.
