# Windows Media Player Custom Visualizations

Microsoft Windows Media Player provides visualizations that enable the user to see visual imagery that is synchronized to the sound of the media content as it plays. Several standard visualizations are included with Windows Media Player, including Spikes, Bars, and DotPlane. This section of the SDK provides programming information that will enable you to create your own visualizations.

The custom visualization documentation is divided into three sections:
