# About the Sample Audio DSP Plug-in

The sample audio DSP plug-in provides a simple processing implementation that scales the amplitude of the audio by a factor provided by the user in the property page. The plug-in accepts values between zero and 1. The default value is 1. A value of 1 has no effect upon the sound; other scale factors are multipliers for the audio samples. For instance, a value of .5 would result in a 6 decibel decrease in volume. A value of zero results in silence.

The sample audio DSP plug-in works with stereo or mono PCM audio.
