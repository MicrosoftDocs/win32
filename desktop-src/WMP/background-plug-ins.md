# Background Plug-ins

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Background UI plug-ins do not actually have user interfaces unless they implement property pages. When one or more background plug-in is running, a special icon appears in the Windows Media Player display next to the running track time. This icon can be clicked to display the background plug-ins options in the Options dialog box. From there, the user can choose to open the property page of any plug-in that supports one.

Background plug-ins are useful for providing automatic services that do not require user input.
