# Background Plug-ins

Background UI plug-ins do not actually have user interfaces unless they implement property pages. When one or more background plug-in is running, a special icon appears in the Windows Media Player display next to the running track time. This icon can be clicked to display the background plug-ins options in the Options dialog box. From there, the user can choose to open the property page of any plug-in that supports one.

Background plug-ins are useful for providing automatic services that do not require user input.
