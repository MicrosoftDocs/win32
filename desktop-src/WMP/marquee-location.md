# Marquee Location

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

You must define the location of the marquee display box you want to use. You must enter four positive integers, separated by commas, that define the left, top, width, and height of the text display box, in pixels, relative to the background image.

A typical value is:


```C++
180,46,50,30 

```
