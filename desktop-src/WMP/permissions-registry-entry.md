# Permissions Registry Entry

When Windows Media Player encounters a custom file name extension, it looks for a registry subkey that matches the extension. The subkey is described in [File Name Extension Registry Settings](file-name-extension-registry-settings.md). One of the registry entries that can appear under the extension's subkey is the **Permissions** entry.

The **Permissions** entry specifies the actions that Windows Media Player is allowed to perform on files that have the custom extension. The **Permissions** entry has the following form.



| Name        | Type           | Value                                                                  |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Permissions | **REG\_DWORD** | A set of flags, each of which grants permission for a specific action. |



 

The value of the **Permissions** entry is a bitwise **OR** of one or more of the following flags.



| Flag (decimal value) | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

When the user attempts to play a media file that has a custom file name extension, Windows Media Player looks for a registry subkey that matches the extension. If no match is found, the Player presents the user with a warning dialog box that prompts the user for permission to attempt to play the file. If you create digital media files with custom file name extensions, you can prevent this warning from appearing on the user's computer by registering the file name extension and providing a **Permissions** entry.

The **Permissions** entry (except for the flag value 128) is supported by Windows Media Player 9 Series and later. The flag value 128 is supported by Windows Media Player 10 and later.
