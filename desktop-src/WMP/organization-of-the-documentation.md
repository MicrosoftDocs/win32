# Organization of the Documentation

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The Windows Media Player SDK documents a wide variety of technologies related to Windows Media Player. To make it easier to locate the information you need, the documentation is divided into sections that help you quickly locate topics about a particular feature or technology.

Where appropriate, major sections each include three subsections: About, Programming Guide, and Reference. The About section describes the particular feature or technology to help you understand how you can use it. The Programming Guide section adds tutorials that take you deeper into the technology with step-by-step instructions. The Reference section details the interfaces, objects, methods, properties, events, elements, and attributes that are available for your use.

The following table will help you to understand where to look for the help you need.
