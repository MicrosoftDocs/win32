# Organization of the Documentation

The Windows Media Player SDK documents a wide variety of technologies related to Windows Media Player. To make it easier to locate the information you need, the documentation is divided into sections that help you quickly locate topics about a particular feature or technology.

Where appropriate, major sections each include three subsections: About, Programming Guide, and Reference. The About section describes the particular feature or technology to help you understand how you can use it. The Programming Guide section adds tutorials that take you deeper into the technology with step-by-step instructions. The Reference section details the interfaces, objects, methods, properties, events, elements, and attributes that are available for your use.

The following table will help you to understand where to look for the help you need.
