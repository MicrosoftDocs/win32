# Co-Branding Online Stores

Personal computer OEMs who do not operate a music store can co-brand with online store providers. Windows Media Player setup supports the ServiceExtra command line parameter to enable hardware OEMs to set a custom attribute that the online store can use to identify which OEM installed the initial online store.

For example, if a computer maker named Fabrikam wants to set the initial online store to the Proseware music store, it might use the following command line to install Windows Media Player 10:


```C++
MP10Setup.exe /q:A /c:"setup_wm.exe /Q /R:N /DefaultService:Proseware /ServiceInfo:c:\Proseware\service_info_local.xml /ServiceExtra:OEM=Fabrikam"
```



When Windows Media Player is installed in this manner, the Player appends the ServiceExtra string each time it opens the Proseware service. The following example shows the URL that Windows Media Player would send to the Proseware service to retrieve the ServiceInfo document:


```C++
https://www.proseware.com/XML/serviceinfo.asp?OEM=Fabrikam
```



The Proseware online store can then use the query string to determine which OEM installed Windows Media Player and return a dynamically generated ServiceInfo document that points to the co-branded version of the online store.
