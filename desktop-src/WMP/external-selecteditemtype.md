# External.selectedItemType

> [!Note]  
> This topic describes functionality designed for use by online stores. Use of this functionality outside the context of an online store is not supported.

 

The **selectedItemType** property retrieves the type of the media item that is currently selected in Windows Media Player.

## Syntax

window.external.selectedItemType()

## Possible Values

This property is a read-only **String** that contains one of the [library location constants](library-location-constants.md).

## Remarks

This property is used in combination with the **External.selectedItemID** property. For example, if **selectedItemType** is equal to CPTrackID, then **selectedItemID** is the ID of the selected track. For more information about how Windows Media Player characterizes views of online store content, see [Location and Selected Item](location-and-selected-item.md).

Certain views in Windows Media Player have a particular media item that is selected. For example, suppose the current view represents an album. An album is a container of tracks, so **selectedItemType** is equal to CPTrackID, and **selectedItemID** is the ID of the selected track. Other views do not have a selected media item. For example, if the user clicks the online store's root node in the tree-view control, Windows Media Player displays a discovery page provided by the online store. The Player does not display any container of media items in the Player user interface. In that case, **selectedItemType** is equal to UnknownLocation, and **selectedItemID** is equal to the empty string.
