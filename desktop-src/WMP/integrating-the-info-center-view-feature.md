# Integrating the Info Center View Feature

Windows Media Player enables users to open and close the Info Center View feature. Info Center View is the feature where users expect to find rich, extended information about specific digital media content. When the user chooses to open Info Center View, Windows Media Player calls on the current music store to display the Info Center View webpage specified by the **URL** attribute of the **InfoCenter** element of the ServiceInfo document.

To retrieve information about the currently playing digital media content, you must embed an instance of the Windows Media Player control in your webpage and use the Player object model. For example, to retrieve the title, you could use the following JScript code:


```C++
// The control was created with ID = "Player"
var title = Player.currentMedia.getItemInfoByType("Title", "", 0);
```



## Guidelines for Info Center View

When creating your **Info Center View** webpage, use the following guidelines:

-   The page must clearly identify the online store providing the information. You can do this by prominently displaying your logo, for example.
-   The page must include a link to your company's privacy statement.
-   Avoid page navigation within the Info Center View feature whenever possible. You should navigate to your online store for most activities.
-   It is best to provide valuable information without requiring the user to install programs or log in to your online store.
