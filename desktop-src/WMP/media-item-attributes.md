# Media Item Attributes

When you look at the library in Windows Media Player, you typically see a great deal of information about a media item. In addition to the name of an audio track, for example, you will likely see the name of the album the track is on, the names of the artist and composer, the genre of the music, and so on.

In the Windows Media Player object model, these metadata items are called attributes. The object model includes properties and methods you can use to query media items and playlists for attributes. You can then display attribute values in your user interface, or your code can take actions based on the value of an attribute.

The following topics describe working with media item attributes.
