# Windows Media Player Mobile Skins

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Windows Media Player Mobile software includes a default skin that consists of various buttons and sliders that you can use to play, rewind, or stop digital media. A skin is a customizable user interface that provides a unique appearance and functionality for Windows Media Player Mobile.
