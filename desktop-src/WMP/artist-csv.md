# artist.csv

This file contains an entry for each artist in the catalog. Each entry is a row composed of the tab-delimited fields described in the table below. Fields must appear in the order listed.

All fields in artist.csv are required.

The Format column in the table below describes the way each Unicode text field is formatted. It does not refer to the data type of the contents. For example, if Integer is indicated in the Format column, it means that the field contains a Unicode string representing an integral value, rather than an actual integer.
