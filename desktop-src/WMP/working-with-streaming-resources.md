# Working with Streaming Resources

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The sample audio DSP plug-in project generated by the Windows Media Player Plug-in Wizard does not require any streaming resources to be allocated by the plug-in. The Echo sample, however, requires a separate buffer to hold the audio data for a period of time to create the delay effect. The buffer is managed by two methods: **IMediaObject::AllocateStreamingResources**, which creates the buffer, and **IMediaObject::FreeStreamingResources**, which releases the buffer. The **IMediaObject** methods are implemented in Echo.cpp.

The following sections provide further information about managing the buffers:

-   [Variables to Manage the Delay Buffer](variables-to-manage-the-delay-buffer.md)
-   [Implementing IMediaObject::AllocateStreamingResources](implementing-imediaobject--allocatestreamingresources.md)
-   [Implementing IMediaObject::FreeStreamingResources](implementing-imediaobject--freestreamingresources.md)
