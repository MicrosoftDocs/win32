# About Custom Visualizations

Windows Media Player provides an interface to create custom visualizations. This section provides an overview of the architecture of visualizations, information about how they relate to Windows Media Player, and the technical details you will need to create custom visualizations.

Note that several places in the code, you will see the word Effect. Visualizations are effects.

Custom visualizations are described in greater detail in the following topics.
