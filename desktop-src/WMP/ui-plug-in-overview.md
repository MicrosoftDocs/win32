# UI Plug-in Overview

UI plug-ins can be installed, uninstalled, and configured using the Plug-ins tab of the Options dialog in Windows Media Player.

There are five types of UI plug-ins supported by Windows Media Player. Three of these types correspond to different areas of the **Now Playing** pane of the full mode of the player. The other two types are for plug-ins that display in a separate window and for plug-ins that have no display (except perhaps a property page).

UI plug-ins are unloaded when they are closed or disabled. UI plug-ins that appear in the **Now Playing** pane are also unloaded when the user chooses another plug-in of the same type or switches out of the **Now Playing** pane. When the user switches to skin mode, all plug-ins remain loaded, but are not displayed. If separate window or background plug-ins are running when Windows Media Player is closed, they will be automatically reloaded the next time the player is started.
