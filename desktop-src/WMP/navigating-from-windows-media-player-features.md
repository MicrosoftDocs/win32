# Navigating from Windows Media Player Features

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

If you provide a music online store, you can perform navigation from Info Center View, album information, and HTMLView pages to your service task panes. The process works exactly as described in [Navigating between Service Task Panes](navigating-between-service-task-panes.md). The difference is that you can navigate from a feature to a service task pane, but not from a service task pane to a feature.
