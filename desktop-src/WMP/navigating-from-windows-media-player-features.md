# Navigating from Windows Media Player Features

If you provide a music online store, you can perform navigation from Info Center View, album information, and HTMLView pages to your service task panes. The process works exactly as described in [Navigating between Service Task Panes](navigating-between-service-task-panes.md). The difference is that you can navigate from a feature to a service task pane, but not from a service task pane to a feature.
