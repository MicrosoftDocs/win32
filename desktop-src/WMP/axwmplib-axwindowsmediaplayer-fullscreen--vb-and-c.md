# AxWindowsMediaPlayer.fullScreen property

The fullScreen property gets or sets a value indicating whether video content is played in full-screen mode.

## Syntax


```CSharp
public System.Boolean fullScreen {get; set;}
```


```VB

Public Property fullScreen As System.Boolean
```





## Property value

A System.Boolean value that indicates whether content is played in full-screen mode. The default value is false.

## Remarks

For full-screen mode to work properly when embedding the Windows Media Player control, the video display area must have a height and width of at least one pixel. If **uiMode** is set to "mini" or "full", the height of the control itself must be 65 or greater to accommodate the video display area in addition to the user interface.

If **uiMode** is set to "invisible", then setting this property to true raises an error and does not affect the behavior of the control.

During full-screen playback, Windows Media Player hides the mouse cursor when [enableContextMenu](axwmplib-axwindowsmediaplayer-enablecontextmenu--vb-and-c.md) equals false and **uiMode** equals "none".

If **uiMode** is set to "full" or "mini", Windows Media Player displays transport controls in full-screen mode when the mouse cursor moves. After a brief interval of no mouse movement, the transport controls are hidden. If **uiMode** is set to "none", no controls are displayed in full-screen mode.

> [!Note]  
> Displaying transport controls in full-screen mode requires the Windows XP operating system.

 

If transport controls are not displayed in full-screen mode, then Windows Media Player automatically exits full-screen mode when playback stops.

## Examples

The following example creates a button that uses the fullScreen property to switch an embedded player object to full-screen mode. The AxWMPLib.AxWindowsMediaPlayer object is represented by the variable named player.


```CSharp
private void fullScreen_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    // If the player is playing, switch to full screen. 
    if (player.playState == WMPLib.WMPPlayState.wmppsPlaying)
    {
        player.fullScreen = true;
    }
}
```


```VB

Public Sub fullScreen_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles fullScreen.Click

    &#39; If the player is playing, switch to full screen. 
    If (player.playState = WMPLib.WMPPlayState.wmppsPlaying) Then

        player.fullScreen = True

    End If

End Sub
```
