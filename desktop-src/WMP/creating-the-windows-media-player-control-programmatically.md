# Creating the Windows Media Player Control Programmatically

When you add the Windows Media Player control to a form from the Toolbox, an object of the class **AxWMPLib.AxWindowsMediaPlayer** is created. This wrapper class gives the Player all the functionality of an ActiveX control, including access to UI properties such as **Location** and **Size**.

If you do not require the properties exposed by **AxWindowsMediaPlayer**, or if your application does not have a graphical user interface, you can create a Player control programmatically. In this case, you create an object of the **WMPLib.WindowsMediaPlayer** class.

> [!Note]  
> Because the **WindowsMediaPlayer** object is not wrapped as an ActiveX control, it does not have any properties inherited from **System.Windows.Forms.Control**. As a result, the **Controls** property is not renamed to **CtlControls**, as it is in **AxWindowsMediaPlayer**.

 

To create the Windows Media Player control programmatically, you must first add a reference to wmp.dll, which is found in the \\Windows\\system32 folder. Adding this reference creates WMPLib.dll in your project folder, and a reference to WMPLib appears in Solution Explorer.

The following example code, part of a Form1 class, shows how to create a **Player** object and play a file. When playback ends, or if the file cannot be played, the form is closed.


```VB
Dim WithEvents Player As WMPLib.WindowsMediaPlayer

Private Sub PlayFile(ByVal url As String)
    Player = New WMPLib.WindowsMediaPlayer
    Player.URL = url
    Player.controls.play()
End Sub

Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) _
                       Handles MyBase.Load
    ' TODO  Insert a valid path in the line below.
    PlayFile("c:\media\myaudio.wma")
End Sub

Private Sub Player_MediaError(ByVal pMediaObject As Object) _
                              Handles Player.MediaError
    MessageBox.Show("Cannot play media file.")
    Me.Close()
End Sub

Private Sub Player_PlayStateChange(ByVal NewState As Integer) _
                                   Handles Player.PlayStateChange
    If NewState = WMPLib.WMPPlayState.wmppsStopped Then
        Me.Close()
    End If
End Sub

```




```CSharp
WMPLib.WindowsMediaPlayer Player;

private void PlayFile(String url)
{
    Player = new WMPLib.WindowsMediaPlayer();
    Player.PlayStateChange += 
        new WMPLib._WMPOCXEvents_PlayStateChangeEventHandler(Player_PlayStateChange);
    Player.MediaError += 
        new WMPLib._WMPOCXEvents_MediaErrorEventHandler(Player_MediaError);
    Player.URL = url;
    Player.controls.play();
}

private void Form1_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    // TODO  Insert a valid path in the line below.
    PlayFile(@"c:\myaudio.wma");
}

private void Player_PlayStateChange(int NewState)
{
    if ((WMPLib.WMPPlayState)NewState == WMPLib.WMPPlayState.wmppsStopped)
    {
        this.Close();
    }
}

private void Player_MediaError(object pMediaObject)
{
    MessageBox.Show("Cannot play media file.");
    this.Close();
}


```
