# Compiling a Catalog Update from Full Catalogs

A catalog update containing the changes between two versions of a compiled catalog can be created by using the syntax below, where *path1* is the directory containing the first catalog, *path2* is the directory containing the second catalog, and debug can be optionally included to display detailed error information on the screen. The catalog files must be in uncompressed form—the file name of the compiled catalog would be catalog.wmdb, rather than catalog.wmdb.lz.


```C++
catcomp diff <path1> <path2> [debug]
```



For example, if the C:\\Catalog210\\ directory contains version 210 of a full compiled catalog and C:\\Catalog211\\ contains version 211, the following command creates a difference file that contains the changes between the two versions:


```C++
catcomp diff C:\Catalog210\ C:\Catalog211\
```



To display detailed error information, you can add the optional debug parameter as follows:


```C++
catcomp diff C:\Catalog210\ C:\Catalog211\ debug
```



If compilation is successful, catcomp.exe creates the output files listed below and saves them in the directory that contains the first catalog.
