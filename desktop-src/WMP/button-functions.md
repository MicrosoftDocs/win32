# Button Functions

You will want to provide the user with buttons to control the selection and playback of media items. Using the appropriate buttons, you can play, pause, or stop the media item, move to different items in the playlist, mute the sound, or provide information about the media item that is playing.

You do not need to provide all button functions in your skin, but the best user experience will probably include at least the PlayPause, Stop, or PlayPauseStop, Prev, and Next button functions.

The following button functions are available:

-   Play
-   Pause
-   Stop
-   Prev
-   Next
-   Shuffle
-   Info
-   RepeatPlaylist
-   Mute
-   PlayPause
-   FullScreen
-   WindowsMedia\*
-   PlayPauseStop\*
-   VolumeUp\*
-   VolumeDown\*

\*Available for Windows Media Player 10 Mobile or later.

For more information about button functions, see the [Buttons](buttons.md) section of the Skin Reference.
