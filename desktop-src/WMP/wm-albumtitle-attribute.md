# WM/AlbumTitle Attribute

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **WM/AlbumTitle** attribute is the title of the album on which the content was originally released.

## Remarks

This attribute is stored in both the library (or cache) and the digital media file.

**Album** is an alias for this attribute.

The Windows Media Format SDK constant for this attribute is g\_wszWMAlbumTitle.
