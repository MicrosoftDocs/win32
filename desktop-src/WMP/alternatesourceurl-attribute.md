# AlternateSourceURL Attribute

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **AlternateSourceURL** attribute is a uniform resource locator for the media item that serves as an alternative to the [**DLNASourceURI**](dlnasourceuri-attribute.md) and [**SourceURL**](sourceurl-attribute.md) attributes.

## Applies To

-   [**Audio Items**](audio-item-attributes.md)
-   [**Photo Items**](photo-item-attributes.md)
-   [**Playlist Items**](playlist-attributes-ref.md)
-   [**Video Items**](video-item-attributes.md)

## Remarks

This attribute is not available for media items in the current user's local library. It is available only for media items that belong to a remote library; that is, a library that has been made available by another user on the home network. To determine whether a media library is remote, call [**IWMPLibrary::get\_type**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmp/nf-wmp-iwmplibrary-get_type).

## Requirements
