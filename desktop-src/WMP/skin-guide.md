# Skin Guide

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This section will describe how to create a simple portrait-mode skin for Windows Media Player 9 Series for Windows Mobile 2003 or later. The following steps will be used:

-   [Choosing the Functions](choosing-the-functions.md)
-   [Designing the Interface](designing-the-interface.md)
-   [Creating the Art](creating-the-art.md)
-   [Writing the Code](writing-the-code.md)
-   [Installing Your Skin](installing-your-skin.md)
