# MOREINFO Element

The **MOREINFO** element specifies a URL to a website, email address, or script command associated with a show, clip, or banner.

``` syntax
<MOREINFO
   HREF = "URL"
   TARGET = "Frame"
/>
```

## Attributes

**HREF** (required)

URL to a website, email address, or script command.

**TARGET**

Value defining the frame or window in which the browser will open the page defined by the **HREF** attribute.

This can be a string containing a window name, or one of the following values.



| Value    | Description                                                                                                              |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \_blank  | The document loads in a new browser window.                                                                              |
| \_self   | The document loads in the same frame as the current document containing the Windows Media Player control.                |
| \_parent | The document loads in the immediate parent frame of the current frame, or the current frame if there is no parent frame. |
| \_top    | The document loads in the full browser window, replacing all other frames or documents.                                  |

| Child elements  | None                           |



 

## Remarks

This element specifies a URL to a website, email address, **or script command. The user can access the target of the URL by clicking on the graphic or text associated with the MOREINFO** element. The details depend on the parent element of the **MOREINFO** element:

-   If the **MOREINFO** element is the child of an **ASX** element, the user can access the URL by clicking the show title.
-   If the **MOREINFO** element is the child of an **ENTRY** element, the user can access the URL by clicking the clip title.
-   If the **MOREINFO** element is the child of a **BANNER** element, the user can access the URL by clicking the banner graphic.

If the **HREF** attribute specifies a URL to a website, the browser opens and navigates to the URL. If the **HREF** attribute specifies an email address, the user's email application starts. If the **HREF** attribute specifies a script command, the script command executes in the browser.

**Note**

If the **MOREINFO** element appears within an **ASX** or **ENTRY** element, when the mouse cursor is held over the title of the show (for an **ASX** element) or clip (for an **ENTRY** element), the URL defined in the **HREF** attribute can be selected and accessed by Windows Media Player.

The **TARGET** attribute defines the frame or window in which the browser will open the page defined by the **HREF** attribute. The values for this attribute follow standard HTML syntax and definitions. In the case of a control embedded in a webpage, if no **TARGET** attribute is defined, the URL loads the current browser window and replaces the existing page, which means the content stops playing. Therefore, it is recommended that you always specify a **TARGET** attribute when embedding the Windows Media Player control in a webpage.

If the metafile is opened in the stand-alone Windows Media Player, the **TARGET** attribute is ignored, and the URL loads in an existing browser window. If there is no browser window currently open, the URL loads in a new browser window.
