# Managing Playlists

A **Playlist** object represents a set of media items. You use properties and methods of the object to manipulate the media items it contains and to retrieve metadata about the playlist. To manage playlists themselves, you use the **PlaylistCollection** object and the **MediaCollection** object.

The following topics describe how to manage playlists using the Windows Media Player control object model:

-   [Playlist Attributes](playlist-attributes.md)
-   [Playlists and Media Items](playlists-and-media-items.md)
-   [Playlists and the PlaylistCollection Object](playlists-and-the-playlistcollection-object.md)
-   [Static and Auto Playlists](static-and-auto-playlists.md)
-   [Playlists and the MediaCollection Object](playlists-and-the-mediacollection-object.md)
