# Managing Playlists

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

A **Playlist** object represents a set of media items. You use properties and methods of the object to manipulate the media items it contains and to retrieve metadata about the playlist. To manage playlists themselves, you use the **PlaylistCollection** object and the **MediaCollection** object.

The following topics describe how to manage playlists using the Windows Media Player control object model:

-   [Playlist Attributes](playlist-attributes.md)
-   [Playlists and Media Items](playlists-and-media-items.md)
-   [Playlists and the PlaylistCollection Object](playlists-and-the-playlistcollection-object.md)
-   [Static and Auto Playlists](static-and-auto-playlists.md)
-   [Playlists and the MediaCollection Object](playlists-and-the-mediacollection-object.md)
