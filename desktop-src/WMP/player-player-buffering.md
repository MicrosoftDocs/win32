# Player.Buffering event

The **Buffering** event occurs when the Windows Media Player control begins or ends buffering or downloading.

## Syntax


```JScript
Player.Buffering(
  Start
)
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*Start* 
</dt> <dd>

**Boolean** containing one of the following values.



| Value | Description            |
|-------|------------------------|
| true  | Buffering has started. |
| false | Buffering has ended.   |



 

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

This event does not return a value.

## Remarks

Use this event to determine when buffering or downloading starts or stops. You can use the same event block for both cases and test *Network*.**bufferingProgress** and *Network*.**downloadProgress** to determine whether Windows Media Player is currently buffering or downloading content.

The value of event parameters is specified by Windows Media Player, and can be accessed or passed to a method in an imported JScript file by using the parameter name given. This parameter name must be typed exactly as shown, including capitalization.

## Requirements



| Requirement | Value |

| Version<br/> | Windows Media Player version 7.0 or later.<br/>                              |
