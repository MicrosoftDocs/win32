# Debugging the Page

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

When Windows Media Player hosts your online store webpage, it disables the ability to open dialog boxes from the webpage. To debug your webpage code, you should instead add code that temporarily prints output to an HTML element on the webpage, such as a DIV or TEXT element.
