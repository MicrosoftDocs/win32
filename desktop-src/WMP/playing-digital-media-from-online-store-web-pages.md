# Playing Digital Media from Online Store Web Pages

You can play digital media content from your online store webpages. Simply embed the Windows Media Player control as described in [Using the Windows Media Player Control in a Web Page](using-the-windows-media-player-control-in-a-web-page.md). When you do this in a service task pane, the embedded control connects to the Windows Media Player program in a fashion similar to remote mode (see [Remoting the Windows Media Player Control](remoting-the-windows-media-player-control.md)). This means that users can use the transport controls of the full mode Player to control playback of digital media in the webpage.

We recommend that you set **uiMode** to "none" or "invisible" when embedding the Player control in a service task pane webpage.
