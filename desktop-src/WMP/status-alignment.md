# Status Alignment

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

You must define the alignment of the status display you want to use. The following table shows the values that are valid.



| Value  | Description                                                                       |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Left   | The text is left-aligned (lined up with the left margin of the status display).   |
| Center | The text is centered in the status display.                                       |
| Right  | The text is right-aligned (lined up with the right margin of the status display). |
