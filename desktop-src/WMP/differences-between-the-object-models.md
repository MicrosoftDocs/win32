# Differences Between the Object Models

There are two primary differences between the Windows Media Player 6.4 object model and the Windows Media Player 7 or later object model.

-   **CLSID** The Windows Media Player 7 or later object model is a complete departure from the version 6.4 object model. The Component Object Model (COM) specification requires that all existing interfaces must continue to function in new versions of a COM component. This means that new interfaces can be added to a COM component, but existing interfaces must never be altered, ensuring older client code will always work with the particular component it was designed to use. Therefore, the Windows Media Player 7 or later ActiveX control has a new class ID: 6BF52A52-394A-11D3-B153-00C04F79FAA6. If you want to take advantage of the new functionality of the control for this version, you must change your CLSID.
-   **Hierarchical Object Model** If you've been using the Windows Media Player 6.4 ActiveX control, you may have noticed that all the properties, methods, and events are accessed through the same object: the **Player** object. By contrast, the Windows Media Player 7 or later object model is organized as a hierarchy of objects. The **Player** object is still the root object, but functions are now accessed through a variety of child objects.
