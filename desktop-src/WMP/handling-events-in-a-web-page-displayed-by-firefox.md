# Handling Events in a Web Page Displayed by Firefox

When you embed the Windows Media Player control in a webpage, you can write script that handles events. For a list of events raised by the Player control, see [Player Object](player-object.md).

If the mime type associated with an embedded Player control is application/x-ms-wmp, you can write event handlers that have the following format:


```HTML
<SCRIPT for="Player" language="jscript" event="EventName(Params)">
  ...
</SCRIPT>
```



where *EventName* is the name of a Windows Media Player event, and *Params* is a list of the event's parameters. For example, the following code has a handler for the [PlayStateChange](player-player-playstatechange.md) event.


```HTML
<OBJECT id="Player" type="application/x-ms-wmp" width="300" height="200">
  <PARAM name="URL" value="c:\MediaFiles\Seattle.wmv"/>
</OBJECT>

<P id="p1">...</P>

<SCRIPT for="Player" event="PlayStateChange(NewState)">
  document.getElementById("p1").innerHTML = "Play state: " + NewState;
</SCRIPT>
```



If you have several instances of the Player control on a webpage and if you use the format shown in the preceeding example, then each event handler is tied to a specific instance of the Player control. In the preceeding example, the event handler is called only when the play state changes for the control that has id="Player".

If the mime type associated with an embedded Player control is not application/x-ms-wmp, you can write event handlers that have the following format:


```HTML
<SCRIPT language="jscript">
  function OnDSEventNameEvt(Params)
  {...}
</SCRIPT>
```



where *EventName* is the name of a Windows Media Player event, and *Params* is a list of the event's parameters. For example, the following code has a handler for the **PlayStateChange** event.


```HTML
<OBJECT id="Player" type="application/asx" width="300" height="200">
  <PARAM name="URL" value="c:\MediaFiles\Test.asx"/>
</OBJECT>

<P id="p1">...</P>

<SCRIPT>
  function OnDSPlayStateChangeEvt(NewState)
  {
    p1.innerHTML = "Play state: " + NewState;
  }
</SCRIPT>

```



If you have several instances of the Player control on a webpage and if you use the format shown in the preceeding example, then each event handler is tied to all instances of the Player control and the event handler is called when the play state changes for any Player control on the page.

> [!Note]  
> If the mime type is not application/x-ms-wmp, the **DoubleClick** event is sent as OnDSDblClickEvt (not OnDSDoubleClickEvt) for compatibility with version 6.4 of the Player control.
