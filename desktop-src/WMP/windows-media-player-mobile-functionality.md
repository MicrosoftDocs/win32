# Windows Media Player Mobile Functionality

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The following actions are available to the user of your skin:

-   Tapping or clicking buttons
-   Sliding trackbars
-   Reading scrolling text
-   Watching video
-   Viewing album art
-   Rating media items

The following sections describe the types of elements you can create to enable these user actions:

-   [Button Functions](button-functions.md)
-   [Trackbar Types](trackbar-types.md)
-   [Text Display Types](text-display-types.md)
