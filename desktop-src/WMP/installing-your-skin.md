# Installing Your Skin

Use the following procedure to install your skin:

1.  Copy all your skin files to a new folder.
2.  Copy the folder containing your skin files to the Windows Media Player folder on your portable device.

    Start Windows Media Player Mobile. This launches the **Skin Chooser**, which has two navigation buttons that allow you to scroll through the available skins, and will display a preview of each one. The name displayed for your skin will be the name of your skin definition file.

3.  Tap **Ok** to select your skin.
