# Installing Your Skin

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Use the following procedure to install your skin:

1.  Copy all your skin files to a new folder.
2.  Copy the folder containing your skin files to the Windows Media Player folder on your portable device.

    Start Windows Media Player Mobile. This launches the **Skin Chooser**, which has two navigation buttons that allow you to scroll through the available skins, and will display a preview of each one. The name displayed for your skin will be the name of your skin definition file.

3.  Tap **Ok** to select your skin.
