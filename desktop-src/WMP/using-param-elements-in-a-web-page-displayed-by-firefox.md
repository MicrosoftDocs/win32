# Using PARAM Elements in a Web Page Displayed by Firefox

You can use PARAM elements inside an OBJECT element to set the initial state of the Player control. For example, the PARAM elements in the following example specify that the control should play seattle.wmv automatically.


```HTML
<OBJECT id="Player" type="application/x-ms-wmp" width="300" height="200">
  <PARAM name="url" value="c:\MediaFiles\seattle.wmv" />
  <PARAM name="autostart" value="true" />
</OBJECT>

```



Most PARAM elements can be interpreted by Internet Explorer and by Firefox. However, there are a few PARAM elements that the Firefox plug-in does not support. For information about which PARAM elements are supported by the Firefox plug-in, see [PARAM Elements in an OBJECT Element](param-elements-in-an-object-element.md).
