# Windows Storage Management Provider

## Purpose

The Windows Storage Management provider can be used to manage a wide range of storage configurations, from single-disk desktops to external storage arrays.

Storage subsystem manufacturers can support Windows-based storage management for their products by implementing a Storage Management Provider (SMP). For more information, see [How to Implement a Storage Management Provider](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=257447).

The Windows Storage Management API supersedes the [Virtual Disk Service](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb986750) API beginning with the Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 operating systems.

-   [Storage Management API Common Return Codes](storage-management-api-common-return-codes.md)

## Developer audience

The Windows Storage Management API is designed for WMI developers who use C/C++, the Microsoft Visual Basic application, or a scripting language that has an engine on Windows and handles Microsoft ActiveX objects. Familiarity with COM programming is helpful but not required. For more information about WMI, see [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa394582).

## Run-time requirements

The Windows Storage Management API is included in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.
