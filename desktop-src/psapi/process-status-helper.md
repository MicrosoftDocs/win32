# Process Status API

The process status application programming interface (PSAPI) is a helper library that makes it easier for you to obtain information about processes and device drivers. For more information, see the following topics:

-   [About PSAPI](about-psapi.md)
-   [Using PSAPI](using-psapi.md)
-   [PSAPI Reference](psapi-reference.md)

These functions are available in Psapi.dll.

The same information is generally available through the performance data in the registry. For more information, see [Performance Counters](/windows/desktop/PerfCtrs/performance-counters-portal).
