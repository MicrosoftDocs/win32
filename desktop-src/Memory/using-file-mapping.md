# Using File Mapping

The following examples demonstrate how two processes might access an existing file as named shared memory:

-   [Creating a View Within a File](creating-a-view-within-a-file.md)
-   [Creating Named Shared Memory](creating-named-shared-memory.md)
-   [Creating a File Mapping Using Large Pages](creating-a-file-mapping-using-large-pages.md)
-   [Obtaining a File Name From a File Handle](obtaining-a-file-name-from-a-file-handle.md)

The processes must synchronize their access to the memory. For more information, see [Synchronization](../sync/synchronization.md).
