# Creating a View Within a File

If you want to view a portion of the file that does not start at the beginning of the file, you must create a file mapping object. This object is the size of the portion of the file you want to view plus the offset into the file. For example, if you want to view the 1 kilobyte (1K) that begins 131,072 bytes (128K) into the file, you must create a file mapping object of at least 132,096 bytes (129K) in size. The view starts 131,072 bytes (128K) into the file and extend for at least 1,024 bytes. This example assumes a file allocation granularity of 64K.

File allocation granularity affects where a map view can start. A map view must start at an offset into the file that is a multiple of the file allocation granularity. So the data you want to view may be the file offset modulo the allocation granularity into the view. The size of the view is the offset of the data modulo the allocation granularity, plus the size of the data that you want to examine.

For example, suppose that the [**GetSystemInfo**](/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsysteminfo) function indicates an allocation granularity of 64K. To examine 1K of data that is 138,240 bytes (135K) into the file, do the following:

1.  Create a file mapping object of at least 139,264 bytes (136K) in size.
2.  Create a file view that starts at a file offset that is the largest multiple of the file allocation granularity less than the offset you require. In this case, the file view starts at offset 131,072 (128K) into the file. The view is 139264 bytes (136K) minus 131,072 bytes (128K), or 8,192 bytes (8K), in size.
3.  Create a pointer offset 7K into the view to access the 1K in which you are interested.

If the data you want straddles a file allocation granularity boundary, you could make the view larger than the file allocation granularity. This avoids breaking the data into pieces.

The following program illustrates the second example above.


```C++
/*
   This program demonstrates file mapping, especially how to align a
   view with the system file allocation granularity.
