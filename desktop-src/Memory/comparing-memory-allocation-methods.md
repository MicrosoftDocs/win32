# Comparing Memory Allocation Methods

The following is a brief comparison of the various memory allocation methods:

-   [**CoTaskMemAlloc**](/windows/win32/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cotaskmemalloc)
-   [**GlobalAlloc**](/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-globalalloc)
-   [**HeapAlloc**](/windows/desktop/api/HeapApi/nf-heapapi-heapalloc)
-   [**LocalAlloc**](/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-localalloc)
-   **malloc**
-   **new**
-   [**VirtualAlloc**](/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc)

Although the [**GlobalAlloc**](/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-globalalloc), [**LocalAlloc**](/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-localalloc), and [**HeapAlloc**](/windows/desktop/api/HeapApi/nf-heapapi-heapalloc) functions ultimately allocate memory from the same heap, each provides a slightly different set of functionality. For example, **HeapAlloc** can be instructed to raise an exception if memory could not be allocated, a capability not available with **LocalAlloc**. **LocalAlloc** supports allocation of handles which permit the underlying memory to be moved by a reallocation without changing the handle value, a capability not available with **HeapAlloc**.

Starting with 32-bit Windows, [**GlobalAlloc**](/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-globalalloc) and [**LocalAlloc**](/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-localalloc) are implemented as wrapper functions that call [**HeapAlloc**](/windows/desktop/api/HeapApi/nf-heapapi-heapalloc) using a handle to the process's default heap. Therefore, **GlobalAlloc** and **LocalAlloc** have greater overhead than **HeapAlloc**.

Because the different heap allocators provide distinctive functionality by using different mechanisms, you must free memory with the correct function. For example, memory allocated with [**HeapAlloc**](/windows/desktop/api/HeapApi/nf-heapapi-heapalloc) must be freed with [**HeapFree**](/windows/desktop/api/HeapApi/nf-heapapi-heapfree) and not [**LocalFree**](/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-localfree) or [**GlobalFree**](/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-globalfree). Memory allocated with [**GlobalAlloc**](/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-globalalloc) or [**LocalAlloc**](/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-localalloc) must be queried, validated, and released with the corresponding global or local function.

The [**VirtualAlloc**](/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc) function allows you to specify additional options for memory allocation. However, its allocations use a page granularity, so using **VirtualAlloc** can result in higher memory usage.

The **malloc** function has the disadvantage of being run-time dependent. The **new** operator has the disadvantage of being compiler dependent and language dependent.

The [**CoTaskMemAlloc**](/windows/win32/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cotaskmemalloc) function has the advantage of working well in either C, C++, or Visual Basic. It is also the only way to share memory in a COM-based application, since MIDL uses **CoTaskMemAlloc** and [**CoTaskMemFree**](/windows/win32/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cotaskmemfree) to marshal memory.
