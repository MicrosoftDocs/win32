An application that is not DPI-aware but is running on a high-DPI display setting can suffer from many visual artifacts, including incorrect scaling of UI elements, clipped text, and blurry images. By adding support in your application for DPI awareness, you guarantee that the presentation of your application's UI is more predictable, making it more visually appealing to users.<br/> |
