# Peer-to-Peer

## Purpose

Peer-to-peer technologies are used to facilitate real-time communication and collaboration across distributed networks.

In the peer-to-peer model, without using Internet servers, each PC user can do the following:

-   Exchange data
-   Share resources
-   Locate other users
-   Communicate
-   Collaborate directly in real time

By using peer-to-peer technologies, applications that coordinate the use of computer CPU cycles and storage can share resources among small or large groups of computers connected to the Internet.

## Where applicable

Developers can use the Peer Infrastructure to create a wide range of distributed, ad-hoc, and peer-to-peer applications.

## Developer audience

Developers using the Peer Infrastructure should be familiar with C programming concepts. Developers using the PNRP Winsock Namespace Provider should be familiar with the Winsock API.

## Run-time requirements

The Peer Infrastructure is supported in Windows Vista, Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2) and later as well the Advanced Networking Pack for Windows XP available for Windows XP with Service Pack 1 (SP1). The Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure requires that IPv6 be installed and initiated to allow peer networking applications to function. Use of Peer-to-Peer Collaboration is only supported in Windows Vista .
