# Installing the Peer Infrastructure

The Windows Peer Networking Infrastructure is a developer platform to create peer applications for computers running Windows XP with Service Pack 1 (SP1) with Advanced Networking Pack, Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2), Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008.

Computers running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 already have Windows Peer Networking Infrastructure installed. For computers running Windows XP with SP2, the following steps are required to install Windows Peer Networking:

-   Click **Start**, click **Control Panel**, and then click **Add or Remove Programs**.
-   Click **Add/Remove Windows Components**.
-   In **Components**, click **Networking Services** (but do not select its check box), and then click **Details**.
-   Select the **Peer** check box, and then click **OK**.
-   Click **Next**, and then follow the instructions in the wizard.

Computers running Windows XP with SP1 require the installation of the [Advanced Networking Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e88cc382-8ce6-4739-97c0-1a52a6f005e4), a free download, to enable Peer Networking.
