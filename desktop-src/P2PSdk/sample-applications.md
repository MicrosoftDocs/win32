# Sample applications (Peer Infrastructure)

The following sample applications are included in the Windows XP Peer SDK. The samples can help you when you develop your own peer applications using the Peer Infrastructure.

-   [Graph Chat](#graph-chat)
-   [Group Chat](#group-chat)
-   [Group Browser](#group-browser)

## Graph Chat

The Graph Chat sample application is a simple chat application that demonstrates how to use the Peer Graphing APIs and the Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRP) Namespace Provider with the Winsock 2 API. The application demonstrates the following tasks:

-   Creating a graph
-   Connecting to an existing graph
-   Disconnecting from an existing graph
-   Enumerating peer entities
-   Adding records to the graph
-   Using direct connections with a graph
-   Using the notification and event infrastructure with graphs
-   Registering names with PNRP
-   Resolving names with PNRP
-   Unregistering names with PNRP

## Group Chat

The Group Chat sample application is a simple chat application that demonstrates how to use the Peer Grouping and Identity Manager APIs. The application demonstrates the following tasks:

-   Creating an identity
-   Creating and obtaining identity information
-   Enumerating identities
-   Enumerating groups associated with an identity
-   Creating a group
-   Creating invitations for a group
-   Connecting to an existing group
-   Disconnecting from an existing group
-   Extracting information from the group properties
-   Using direct connections with a group
-   Using the enumeration functions within a group
-   Enumerating group members
-   Adding records to a group
-   Using the notification and event infrastructure with groups

## Group Browser

The Group Browser sample application is a simple peer group management tool that demonstrates how to use the Peer Grouping and Identity Manager APIs. The application demonstrates the following tasks:

-   Enumerating PNRP clouds
-   Enumerating identities
-   Enumerating groups associated with an identity
-   Creating and deleting identities
-   Creating a group and associating it with an identity
-   Creating an invitation and saving it
-   Opening an invitation and using it to join a group
-   Deleting an identity and group membership
-   Connecting to an existing group
-   Disconnecting from an existing group
-   Extracting information from group properties
-   Using the enumeration functions within a group
-   Enumerating group members
-   Using the notification and event infrastructure with groups
