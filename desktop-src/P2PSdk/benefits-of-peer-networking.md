# Benefits of Peer Networking

The Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure provides a complete solution for you to create peer-to-peer networking applications. You can use the Peer-to-Peer Graphing, Grouping, Identity Manager, and PNRP Namespace Provider APIs to create new, exciting, and robust peer-to-peer applications. The Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure provides a solid networking infrastructure so that you can concentrate on **developing** applications, because the infrastructure is developed for you.

## Design Features

The Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure provides the following features:

| Feature            | Description                                          |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Secure**         | Robustness if there are failures or directed attacks |
| **Scalable**       | Scalability from simple LANs to the entire Internet  |
| **Serverless**     | No central point of failure                          |
| **Self-tuning**    | Adapts to changes within the infrastructure          |
| **Self-repairing** | Automatically repairs and corrects itself            |
| **Sharing**        | Enables sharing from edge-of-network endpoints       |



 

By using the Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure, you can create the following types of applications:

-   Real-time networking and communication
-   Collaboration
-   Content distribution
-   Distributed processing coordination
-   Internet technologies and protocols

## Alternative to DNS

Because peer-to-peer entities participate and communicate on an ad hoc basis, the Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure is an effective alternative to DNS for name resolution. The Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure uses the PNRP Namespace Provider API to provide a serverless mechanism for resolving peer-to-peer names.
