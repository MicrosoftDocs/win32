| [Property Edit Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/tree/master/Samples/Win7Samples/winui/shell/appplatform/PropertyEdit)                          | Demonstrates how to use the Windows Property System APIs to read and write file property values.                                                                                                                            |
| [Property Schema Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/tree/master/Samples/Win7Samples/winui/shell/appplatform/propertyschemas)                      | Demonstrates how to register and unregister, custom properties and how to get detailed information about custom property schemas that are already registered with the system.                                               |
| [Recipe Property Handler Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/tree/master/Samples/Win7Samples/winui/shell/appshellintegration/RecipePropertyHandler) | Demonstrates the implementation of a property handler for custom format recipe (.recipe) files.                                                                                                                             |
