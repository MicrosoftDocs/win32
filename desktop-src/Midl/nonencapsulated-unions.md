# Nonencapsulated Unions

A nonencapsulated union is a union which is not contained in a structure with its discriminant. The nonencapsulated union is indicated by the presence of the type attribute **\[switch\_type\]** and the field attribute **\[switch\_is\]**.

For a description of the form of an nonencapsulated union, see [**union**](union.md).

The shape of unions must be the same across platforms to ensure interconnectivity.

For more information, see [Encapsulated Unions](encapsulated-unions.md), [**union**](union.md), **\[**[**switch\_is**](switch-is.md)**\]** and **\[**[**switch\_type**](switch-type.md)**\]**.
