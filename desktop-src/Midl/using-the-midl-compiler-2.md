# Using the MIDL Compiler

The MIDL compiler is automatically installed as part of the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) setup. The following topics describe the MIDL C compiler and C preprocessor requirements, the link libraries that are part of the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) product, and the files that MIDL generates for DCOM interfaces, RPC interfaces, and OLE Automation type library interfaces.

-   [Invoking the MIDL Compiler](invoking-the-midl-compiler.md)
-   [Response Files](response-files.md)
-   [C-Preprocessor Requirements for MIDL](c-preprocessor-requirements-for-midl.md)
-   [C/C++-Compiler Considerations](c-c-compiler-considerations.md)
-   [Using the \_\_midl Predefined Constant](using-the---midl-predefined-constant.md)
-   [MIDL and RPC](midl-and-rpc.md)
-   [MIDL and COM](midl-and-com.md)
-   [MIDL and ODL](midl-and-odl.md)

For more information about the files that make up the RPC product, see [Installing the RPC Programming Environment](/windows/desktop/Rpc/installing-the-rpc-programming-environment).
