# MIDL Structures

Normal C semantics apply to the fields of base types. Fields of more complex types, such as pointers, arrays, and other constructed types, can be modified by type or [**field\_attributes**](/windows/desktop/Rpc/field-attributes). For more information, see [**struct**](struct.md).
