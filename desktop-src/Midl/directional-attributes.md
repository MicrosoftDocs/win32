# Directional Attributes

Apply directional attributes to parameters to indicate the direction that data is being passed. Both attributes can be applied to a single parameter, but doing so increases the overhead associated with a call.



| Attribute              | Usage                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**in**](in.md)       | The parameter is being passed from the caller to the called function. |
| [**out**](out-idl.md) | The parameter is being passed from the called function to the caller. |
