# MIDL and RPC

When you develop an RPC application, you use a text editor to create an IDL file that defines the interface between the client and the server. You use the MIDL compiler to generate source files that your client and server programs require. The following topics present information on the use of the MIDL compiler for RPC applications:

-   [Files Generated for an RPC Interface](files-generated-for-an-rpc-interface.md)
-   [Targeting Stubs for Specific 32-bit or 64-bit Platforms](targeting-stubs-for-specific-32-bit-or-64-bit-platforms.md)

For more information, see [Building RPC Applications](/windows/desktop/Rpc/building-rpc-applications).
