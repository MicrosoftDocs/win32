# MIDL and COM

All COM objects implement one or more interfaces. When you create a custom COM object, you must describe the interface or interfaces in an IDL file. The topics in this section present information on using MIDL to define COM interfaces:

-   [Files Generated for a COM Interface](files-generated-for-a-com-interface.md)
-   [Marshaling OLE Data Types](marshaling-ole-data-types.md)

For more information on defining COM interfaces with MIDL, see [Defining COM Interfaces](../com/defining-com-interfaces.md). For more information on building generated files for various platforms, see [Targeting Stubs for Specific 32-bit or 64-bit Platforms](targeting-stubs-for-specific-32-bit-or-64-bit-platforms.md).
