| [Device Access API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh404244)<br/>   | The Device Access API enables developers to write Windows Store apps for custom devices. The API applies a policy to grant a Windows Store app the appropriate level of access to a device, and if access is granted, provides methods for sending control codes to operate the device.<br/>                                                                                         |
| [AllJoyn API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/mt270094)<br/>                           | AllJoyn is a DCOM-like framework and protocol for making remotable method calls and/or sending one-way signals between applications on a distributed bus. It is intended to be used primarily for Internet of Things type scenarios. <br/>                                                                                                                                           |
| [Point of Service API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn298071)<br/>    | Point of Service API enables application developers to access Point of Service (POS) peripheral devices. The namespace provides a vendor-neutral interface for accessing POS devices from various manufacturers from the Windows Store apps.<br/>                                                                                                                                    |
| [Communications Resources](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa363196)<br/>           | A communications resource is a physical or logical device that provides a single bidirectional, asynchronous data stream. Serial ports, parallel ports, fax machines, and modems are examples of communications resources. For each communications resource, there is a service provider, consisting of a library or driver, that enables applications to access the resource. <br/> |
| [Device Management](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa363224)<br/>                         | Device management provides a way to uniformly notify all applications and system components of changes that may affect their operation or access to resources. Applications and the system use and process device events to take advantage of new resources when they become available and to prevent loss of data when existing resources become unavailable. <br/>                 |
| [Enhanced Storage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd430343)<br/>                  | The Enhanced Storage API enables consistent end-to-end authentication for personal storage devices that differ in form factor. <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
