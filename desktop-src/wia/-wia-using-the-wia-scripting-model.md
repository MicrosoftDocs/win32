# Using the WIA Scripting Model

Through the [WIA Scripting Model](-wia-wia-scripting-model.md), Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) functionality is made available to scripting languages such as Microsoft JScript development software and Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), and high-level languages such as Microsoft Visual Basic development system.

> [!Note]  
> This scripting system has been replaced with Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) Automation Layer. See [Windows Image Acquisition Automation Layer](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wiaaut/-wiaaut-startpage).

 

The WIA scripting model exposes objects that inherit the [IDispatch](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch) interface.

The scripting model offers a simplified version of the WIAAPI.
