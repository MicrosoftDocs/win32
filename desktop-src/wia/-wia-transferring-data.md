# Transferring Data

> [!Note]  
> This scripting system has been replaced with Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) Automation Layer. See [Windows Image Acquisition Automation Layer](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wiaaut/-wiaaut-startpage).

 

Use the [**Transfer**](-wia-iwiadispatchitem-transfer.md) method of an [**Item**](-wia-item.md) object to transfer image or audio data from a device to a file or the clipboard.

Pass a path and filename as the first parameter to save the data to disk, or pass the string "clipboard" to transfer the item to the clipboard.
