# Device Information Properties (WIA\_DIP\_XXXX)

Device Information Properties are properties that describe the setup and installation of the device. These properties are available through the [**IWiaDevMgr**](/windows/desktop/api/wia_xp/nn-wia_xp-iwiadevmgr) or [**IWiaDevMgr2**](-wia-iwiadevmgr2.md) interfaces and also through the root item. Device information properties are prefixed with WIA\_DIP (**Device Information Property**), and are supplied by WIA. For more information, see [**Device Information Property Constants**](-wia-wiadeviceinfoprop.md).
