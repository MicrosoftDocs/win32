# WiaDeviceInfoPropertyId

Device Information Properties are properties that describe the setup and installation of the device. These properties are available through the [**IWiaDevMgr**](/windows/desktop/api/wia_xp/nn-wia_xp-iwiadevmgr) interface and also through the root item.

Device information properties are prefixed with "WIA\_DIP\_" (Device Information Property) when used in C/C++, and are supplied by Windows Image Acquisition (WIA). For scripting purposes these constants use the prefix "DeviceInfo" and are part of the WiaDeviceInfoPropertyId enumerated type. See [**Device Information Property Constants**](-wia-wiadeviceinfoprop.md) for more information.
