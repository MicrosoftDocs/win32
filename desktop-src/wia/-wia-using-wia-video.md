# Using WIA Video

WIA provides the [**IWiaVideo**](/windows/desktop/api/Wiavideo/nn-wiavideo-iwiavideo) interface to enable applications to display streaming video in a window, capture still images from the video stream, and save those images as JPEG files.

The following sections explain how to use Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) video capabilities:

-   [Previewing Video](-wia-previewing-video.md)
-   [Capturing a Still Image from a Video Stream](-wia-capturing-a-still-image-from-a-video-stream.md)

> [!Note]  
> WIA does not support video devices in Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, or later. For those versions of the Windows, use [DirectShow](/previous-versions//ms783323(v=vs.85)) to acquire images from video.
