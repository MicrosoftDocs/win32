# STI Compatibility

The Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) architecture is built upon the foundation established by the Still Image Architecture (STI). WIA device drivers will be compliant with STI's User Mode Driver (USD) model. While the original USD's purpose is to support TWAIN data sources and other APIs, WIA drivers support the new WIA application interface.
