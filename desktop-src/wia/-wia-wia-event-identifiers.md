# WIA Event Identifiers

WIA event identifiers are globally unique identifiers (GUID) defined by the Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) system.

A WIA application can subscribe to these non-persistent events by using [**IwiaDevMgr2::RegisterEventCallbackInterface**](-wia-iwiadevmgr2-registereventcallbackinterface.md) to receive device status change notifications from the WIA device to which the current WIA application session is connected. The WIA mini-driver must ensure that WIA\_DPS\_DOCUMENT\_HANDLING\_STATUS is correctly updated before the driver signals one of these events.

The following are valid WIA event GUIDs: 

| GUID                             | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| WIA\_EVENT\_CANCEL\_IO           | The application attempts to cancel a data transfer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| WIA\_EVENT\_COVER\_CLOSED        | All scanner covers are closed. If there were multiple scanner covers opened, the WIA minidriver should signal this event only when the last cover was closed. This feature is available starting with Windows 8.                                                                                                                      |
| WIA\_EVENT\_COVER\_OPEN          | A scanner cover was opened by the operator. The device cannot scan at this time. The WIA minidriver should signal this event only once if multiple scanner covers are opened in succession. This feature is available starting with Windows 8.                                                                                        |
| WIA\_EVENT\_DEVICE\_CONNECTED    | A WIA hardware device was connected to the user's computer or started.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| WIA\_EVENT\_DEVICE\_DISCONNECTED | A WIA hardware device was disconnected from the user's computer or stopped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| WIA\_EVENT\_DEVICE\_NOT\_READY   | The device entered not-ready state. The application should read WIA\_DPS\_DOCUMENT\_HANDLING\_STATUS for more information. This feature is available starting with Windows 8.                                                                                                                                                         |
| WIA\_EVENT\_DEVICE\_READY        | The device entered ready state. The previous not-ready state signaled with WIA\_EVENT\_DEVICE\_NOT\_READY was cleared. This feature is available starting with Windows 8.                                                                                                                                                             |
| WIA\_EVENT\_FEEDER\_EMPTIED      | The operator removed all documents from the feeder input tray and the feeder is empty. The device cannot scan from the feeder at this time. Important: the minidriver must not signal this event when the feeder becomes empty as result of a scan job executed by an application. This feature is available starting with Windows 8. |
| WIA\_EVENT\_FEEDER\_LOADED       | The operator placed documents in the feeder input tray. The feeder is loaded with paper. The application can initiate a scan job from the feeder at this time. This feature is available starting with Windows 8.                                                                                                                     |
| WIA\_EVENT\_FLATBED\_LID\_CLOSED | The flatbed lid was closed by the operator. The application can initiate a scan job from the flatbed at this time. This feature is available starting with Windows 8.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| WIA\_EVENT\_FLATBED\_LID\_OPEN   | The flatbed lid was opened by the operator. The device cannot scan from the flatbed at this time.

| WIA\_EVENT\_ITEM\_CREATED        | An item was added to the tree of [**IWiaItem**](/windows/desktop/api/wia_xp/nn-wia_xp-iwiaitem) or [**IWiaItem2**](-wia-iwiaitem2.md) objects for a WIA device.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
