# Networking and Internet

Windows has APIs, components, and services that support your desktop apps' use of networking and the Internet. They provide:

-   HTTP APIs.
-   Network and network management.
-   DNS and DHCP.
-   Networking capabilities that are independent of particular network implementations.
-   Remote Access Service.
-   Telephony and fax.

Delivery Optimization allows devices to download updates from alternate sources (such as other peers on the network), in addition to Microsoft servers. Delivery Optimization combines partial bits from local devices, with partial bits from Microsoft servers to update devices in the network environment. The expected result is reduced bandwidth usage, and a faster update process.<br/> |
