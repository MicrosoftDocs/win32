# JetGotoPosition Function


_**Applies to:** Windows | Windows Server_

## JetGotoPosition Function

The **JetGotoPosition** function moves a cursor to a new location that is a fraction of the way through the current index. The fraction is approximately equal to the following:

precpos-\>centriesLT/precpos-\>centriesTotal

This operation is performed in response to user scroll box input that is received when the user attempts to show data that starts part way through a data set.

```cpp
    JET_ERR JET_API JetGotoPosition(
      __in          JET_SESID sesid,
      __in          JET_TABLEID tableid,
      __in          JET_RECPOS* precpos
    );
```

### Parameters

*sesid*

The session to use for this call.

*tableid*

The cursor to use for this call.

*precpos*

The description of the fraction to use in positioning the cursor in the current index.

### Return Value

This function returns the [JET_ERR](./jet-err.md) datatype with one of the following return codes. For more information about the possible ESE errors, see [Extensible Storage Engine Errors](./extensible-storage-engine-errors.md) and [Error Handling Parameters](./error-handling-parameters.md).


| <p>Return code</p> | <p>Description</p> | 
|--------------------|--------------------|
| <p>JET_errSuccess</p> | <p>The operation completed successfully.</p> | 
| <p>JET_errClientRequestToStopJetService</p> | <p>The operation could not complete because all activity on the instance that is associated with the session has ceased as a result of a call to <a href="gg269240(v=exchg.10).md">JetStopService</a>.</p> | 
| <p>JET_errInstanceUnavailable</p> | <p>The operation could not complete because the instance that is associated with the session has encountered a fatal error that requires that access to all data be revoked to protect the integrity of that data.</p><p><strong>Windows XP:</strong>  This return value is introduced in Windows XP.</p> | 
| <p>JET_errInvalidParameter</p> | <p>The given precpos-&gt;cbStruct is not a valid size for the <a href="gg269308(v=exchg.10).md">JET_RECPOS</a> structure, or precpos-&gt;centriesLT is greater than precpos-&gt;centriesTotal.</p> | 
| <p>JET_errNotInitialized</p> | <p>The operation cannot complete because the instance that is associated with the session has not yet been initialized.</p> | 
| <p>JET_errRecordNotFound</p> | <p>This error will be returned if the index is empty.</p> | 
| <p>JET_errRestoreInProgress</p> | <p>The operation cannot complete because a restore operation is in progress on the instance that is associated with the session.</p> | 
| <p>JET_errSessionSharingViolation</p> | <p>The same session cannot be used for more than one thread at the same time.</p><p><strong>Windows XP:</strong>  This return value is introduced in Windows XP.</p> | 
| <p>JET_errTermInProgress</p> | <p>The operation cannot complete because the instance that is associated with the session is being shut down.</p> | 



If this function succeeds, the cursor is moved to a current record that is a fraction of the way through the index where the fraction is precpos-\>centriesLT divided by precpos-\>centriesTotal.

If this function fails, the cursor location is left unchanged.

#### Remarks

This operation moves the cursor through the table to a position at the following approximate point: precpos-\>centriesLT divided by precpos-\>centriesTotal.

When updates are occurring continuously on the table, subsequent calls with the same [JET_RECPOS](./jet-recpos-structure.md) can move the cursor to different positions in the index, both before and after the previous position. Transactional isolation does not apply to positioning through [JET_RECPOS](./jet-recpos-structure.md) since it depends on physical properties of the index that are not transaction isolated.

[JET_RECPOS](./jet-recpos-structure.md) should not be used to describe a record within a table or to reposition a record close to an existing record. Instead, bookmarks for an existing record should be retrieved after an initial **JetGotoPosition** and then used to reposition the same record.

#### Requirements


| Requirement | Value |
|------------|----------|
| <p><strong>Client</strong></p> | <p>Requires Windows Vista, Windows XP, or Windows 2000 Professional.</p> | 
| <p><strong>Server</strong></p> | <p>Requires Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2003, or Windows 2000 Server.</p> | 
| <p><strong>Header</strong></p> | <p>Declared in Esent.h.</p> | 
| <p><strong>Library</strong></p> | <p>Use ESENT.lib.</p> | 
| <p><strong>DLL</strong></p> | <p>Requires ESENT.dll.</p> |
