_**Applies to:** WindowsÂ | Windows Server_

## Extensible Storage Engine Error Codes

The following error codes (flags) are used by functions in the Extensible Storage Engine API.

A [JET_ERR](./jet-err.md) value of zero should be interpreted as success.


| <p>Success</p> | <p>Description</p> | 
|----------------|--------------------|
| <p>JET_errSuccess 0</p> | <p>The function succeeded.</p> | 



A [JET_ERR](./jet-err.md) value that is greater than zero should be interpreted as a warning.
