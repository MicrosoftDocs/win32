# JET_ERRINFOBASIC_W Structure


_**Applies to:** WindowsÂ | Windows Server_

## JET_ERRINFOBASIC_W Structure

The **JET_ERRINFOBASIC_W** structure defines the data that is returned from the [JetGetErrorInfo()](./jetgeterrorinfow-function.md) method when the JET_ErrorInfoSpecificErr InfoLevel is passed in.

Note: This documentation is based on a preliminary release of the Extensible Storage Engine. This information is subject to change.

```cpp
typedef struct { 
    unsigned long cbStruct; 
    JET_ERR errValue; 
    JET_ERRCAT errcatMostSpecific; 
    unsigned char rgCategoricalHierarchy[8]; 
    unsigned long lSourceLine; 
    WCHAR rgszSourceFile[64]; 
} JET_ERRINFOBASIC_W;
```

### Members

**cbStruct**

The size of the structure, in bytes. It must be set to sizeof( JET_ERRINFOBASIC ).

**errValue**

The error value that was evaluated, as passed in for the *pvResult* argument to [JetGetErrorInfo()](./jetgeterrorinfow-function.md).

**errcatMostSpecific**

The lowest-level [JET_ERRCAT](./jet-errcat.md) constant that is associated with the error; that is, the leaf-level category in the category hierarchy documented in [JET_ERRCAT](./jet-errcat.md).

**rgCategoricalHierarchy\[8\]**

The hierarchy of error categories that is associated with the error. Position 0 is the highest level in the hierarchy of [JET_ERRCAT](./jet-errcat.md), and the rest are subcategories until the most specific category is set, after which all categories are JET_errcatUnknown.

**lSourceLine**

Reserved.

**rgszSourceFile\[64\]**

Reserved.
