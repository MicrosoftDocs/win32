_**Applies to:** Windows | Windows Server_

## JET_LOGTIME Structure

The **JET_LOGTIME** structure holds elements of the date and time of an event.

```cpp
typedef struct {
  char bSeconds;
  char bMinutes;
  char bHours;
  char bDay;
  char bMonth;
  char bYear;
  union {
    char bFiller1;
    struct {
        unsigned char fTimeIsUTC: 1;
        unsigned char fUnused: 7;
    };
  };
  char bFiller2;
} JET_LOGTIME;
```

### Members
