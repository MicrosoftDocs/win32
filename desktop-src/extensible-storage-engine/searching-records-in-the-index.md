# Searching Records in the Index

## Searching Records in the Index

Search keys are created to search for a single entry or a set of entries in an index. Search keys may only be constructed for the key columns in the index, and may contain one or more column values. The search key is constructed with a single call or a series of calls to [JetMakeKey](./jetmakekey-function.md), and may be retrieved with [JetRetrieveKey](./jetretrievekey-function.md) using JET_bitRetrieveCopy. After the search key is constructed it can be used to move the cursor to the record in the index.

There are three methods of finding records in a table:

1.  Search for a single index entry. To do this, create the search key with [JetMakeKey](./jetmakekey-function.md), and then move to that record with [JetSeek](./jetseek-function.md).

2.  Search the index record-by-record. Records can be traversed one record at a time by calling [JetMove](./jetmove-function.md). The cursor can be moved to the first record in the index by specifying JET_MoveFirst in the *cRow* parameter of [JetMove](./jetmove-function.md). In the same way, the cursor can be moved forward, backward, or to the last entry in the index.

3.  Search through a set of records. To do this, set a range of index entries to search, then move through the records sequentially. For more information, see [Searching Through a Set of Records]() section of this topic.

### Searching Through a Set of Records

The diagram here shows the cursor moving through a range of index entries defined by calls to [JetSeek](./jetseek-function.md) and [JetSetIndexRange](./jetsetindexrange-function.md).

Use the following procedure to search through a set of records in an index.

### To search a set of records in an index

1.  Create the search key for the first record in the set of records to be searched with [JetMakeKey](./jetmakekey-function.md).

2.  Move the cursor to the record indicated in the search key with [JetSeek](./jetseek-function.md).

3.  Create another search key for the last index entry in the range with [JetMakeKey](./jetmakekey-function.md).

4.  Set the index range with [JetSetIndexRange](./jetsetindexrange-function.md) using the key created in step 3.

5.  Call [JetMove](./jetmove-function.md) to move sequentially through each record in the index range as shown in the following diagram.

![ESE_Documentation_IndexRange](images/Gg269342.ESE_Documentation_IndexRange(EXCHG.10).gif "ESE_Documentation_IndexRange")

The cursor in the diagram here may only move through the range of indices set in the call to [JetSetIndexRange](./jetsetindexrange-function.md). If the application attempts to move the cursor beyond the index range, ESE returns a Jet_errNoCurrentRecord error from the call to [JetMove](./jetmove-function.md). Note that any type of navigation with this cursor other than moving to the next or previous record will cancel the index range. See [JetSetIndexRange](./jetsetindexrange-function.md) for more information.

The type of data entered in the *pvData* parameter for [JetMakeKey](./jetmakekey-function.md) must match the type of data and properties specified for the column. For example, calling [JetMakeKey](./jetmakekey-function.md) with "Ben Miller" specified in the *pvData* parameter for a column type JET_coltypText is a valid data type match. If you want to create a search key to search between the names "Ben Miller" and "Max Stevens" in an index, move the cursor to the record with the name "Ben Miller" by calling [JetSeek](./jetseek-function.md). Call [JetMakeKey](./jetmakekey-function.md) a second time and specify a pointer to a string containing the name "Max Stevens". The index range is set to limit the cursor to move between the names "Ben Miller" and "Max Stevens" in the call to [JetSetIndexRange](./jetsetindexrange-function.md).
