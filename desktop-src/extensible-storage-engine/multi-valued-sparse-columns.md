# Multi-Valued Sparse Columns

## Multi-Valued Sparse Columns

Sparse columns may be fixed or variable length, and are unique in that they do not take up space in a record if they are NULL or left to their default value. Sparse columns, also referred to as tagged columns, can contain more than one value in a single record. Tagged columns can be any of the columns types described in the [JET_coltyp](./jet-coltyp.md) constants. They are created when the column is added to the table by setting the JET_bitColumnTagged flag in the [JET_COLUMNDEF](./jet-columndef-structure.md) structure in the call to [JetAddColumn](./jetaddcolumn-function.md), or in the [JET_COLUMNCREATE](./jet-columncreate-structure.md) structure used in the call to [JetCreateTableColumnIndex](./jetcreatetablecolumnindex-function.md) or [JetCreateTableColumnIndex2](./jetcreatetablecolumnindex2-function.md). Columns of type JET_coltypLongText and JET_coltypLongBinary are automatically created as tagged columns.

Only tagged columns can contain multiple values in a record, fixed or variable length columns may not contain multiple values. There are two types of multi-valued columns:

  - Tagged columns are multi-valued by default. When a second value is added to the column, it automatically becomes multi-valued.

  - Tagged columns that are created with the JET_bitColumnMultiValued option in the [JET_COLUMNDEF](./jet-columndef-structure.md) structure in the call to [JetAddColumn](./jetaddcolumn-function.md).

The JET_bitColumnMultiValued option changes the way that the column is indexed. Multi-valued columns with the JET_bitColumnMultiValued option are indexed more extensively than tagged multi-valued columns. These columns are indexed over all values in the multi-valued column, whereas tagged multi-valued columns are only indexed over the first value in the multi-valued column. For example, consider a multi-valued column where the JET_bitColumnMultiValued option is set and it is the first multi-valued column in an index. This column contains three values: A, B, and C. An index over this column contains entries for all three values, A, B, and C. If the JET_bitColumnMultiValued option was not set, the index over this column only contains the first value, A, in the index.
