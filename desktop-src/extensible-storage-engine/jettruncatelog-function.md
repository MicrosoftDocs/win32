# JetTruncateLog Function


_**Applies to:** Windows | Windows Server_

## JetTruncateLog Function

The **JetTruncateLog** function is used during a backup that is initiated by [JetBeginExternalBackup](./jetbeginexternalbackup-function.md) to delete any transaction log files that will no longer be needed once the current backup completes successfully.

```cpp
    JET_ERR JET_API JetTruncateLog(void);
```

### Parameters

This function has no parameters.

### Return Value

This function returns the [JET_ERR](./jet-err.md) datatype with one of the following return codes. For more information about the possible ESE errors, see [Extensible Storage Engine Errors](./extensible-storage-engine-errors.md) and [Error Handling Parameters](./error-handling-parameters.md).

If this function succeeds, the set of transaction log files that will no longer be needed once the current backup completes successfully are deleted. The backup state machine will be advanced such that the backup of database files is no longer allowed. Only database patch files and transaction log files are permitted to be opened for backup beyond this point.

If this function fails, the backup state machine can be advanced such that the backup of database files is no longer allowed. Some number of transaction log files might be deleted that is less than the desired number, but they will always be deleted from oldest to youngest.
