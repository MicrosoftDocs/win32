# JetGetAttachInfo Function


_**Applies to:** Windows | Windows Server_

## JetGetAttachInfo Function

The **JetGetAttachInfo** function is used during a backup initiated by [JetBeginExternalBackup](./jetbeginexternalbackup-function.md) to query an instance for the names of database files that should become part of the backup file set. Only databases currently attached to the instance using [JetAttachDatabase](./jetattachdatabase-function.md) will be considered. These files may subsequently be opened using [JetOpenFile](./jetopenfile-function.md) and read using [JetReadFile](./jetreadfile-function.md).

```cpp
    JET_ERR JET_API JetGetAttachInfo(
      __out_opt     tchar* szz,
      __in          unsigned long cbMax,
      __out_opt     unsigned long* pcbActual
    );
```

### Parameters

*szz*

The output buffer that receives the list of null terminated strings describing the set of database files that should be a part of the backup file set. The list of strings returned in this buffer is in the same format as a multi-string used by the registry. Each null-terminated string is returned in sequence followed by a final null terminator.

*cbMax*

The maximum size in bytes of the output buffer.

*pcbActual*

Pointer to the output buffer that received the actual amount of string data.

### Return Value

This function returns the [JET_ERR](./jet-err.md) datatype with one of the following return codes. For more information about the possible ESE errors, see [Extensible Storage Engine Errors](./extensible-storage-engine-errors.md) and [Error Handling Parameters](./error-handling-parameters.md).

On success, the requested information on the set of database files that should be part of the backup file set will be placed in the output buffers where provided.

On failure, the state of the output buffers is undefined. The failure will result in the cancellation of the entire backup process for the instance.

#### Remarks

It is important to note that this API does not return an error or warning if the output buffer is too small to accept the full list of files that should be part of the backup file set. The application should always provide a buffer to receive the actual size of this list and use that information to determine if the list was truncated.
