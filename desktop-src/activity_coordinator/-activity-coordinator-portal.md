# Activity Coordinator API

## Purpose

The Activity Coordinator API coordinates execution of deferrable tasks on a system. Deferrable tasks are those tasks which donâ€™t need to be run immediately. They can defer their execution to a time when the system is in a desired state where running the task does not interfere with other ongoing work.

## Developer audience

The Activity Coordinator API is designed for use by professional C/C++ developers of Windows applications. Developers can use the API to get notifications of when the system is in the desired state to run a particular task.

## Run-time requirements

The Activity Coordinator API is available beginning with Windows 11, version 22H2.
