# LOCALE\_SNAME

**WindowsÂ Vista and later:** Locale name, a multi-part tag to uniquely identify the locale. The maximum number of characters allowed for this string is [LOCALE_NAME_MAX_LENGTH](locale-name-constants.md), including a terminating null character. The tag is based on the language tagging conventions of [IETF BCP 47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47). The pattern to use is described in [Locale Names](locale-names.md).
