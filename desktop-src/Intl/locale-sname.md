# LOCALE\_SNAME

**Windows Vista and later:** Locale name, a multi-part tag to uniquely identify the locale. The maximum number of characters allowed for this string is 85, including a terminating null character. The tag is based on the language tagging conventions of RFC 4646. The pattern to use is described in [Locale Names](locale-names.md).
