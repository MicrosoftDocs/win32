# LOCALE\_SDATE

Character(s) for the date separator. The maximum number of characters allowed for this string is four, including a terminating null character.

**Windows Vista and later:** This constant is deprecated. Use [LOCALE\_SSHORTDATE](locale-sshortdate.md) instead. A custom locale might not have a single, uniform separator character. For example, a format such as "12/31, 2006" is valid.
