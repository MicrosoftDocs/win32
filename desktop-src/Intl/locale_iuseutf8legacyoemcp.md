# LOCALE\_IUSEUTF8LEGACYOEMCP

**Beginning with the next version of Windows:** It is recommended that applications use Unicode instead. On machines that the user has configured to use a UTF-8 codepage, LOCALE_IUSEUTF8LEGACYOEMCP is the legacy OEM codepage that would have been used on a non-UTF-8 legacy Windows machine.
