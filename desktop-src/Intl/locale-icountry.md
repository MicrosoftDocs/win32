# LOCALE\_IDIALINGCODE and LOCALE\_ICOUNTRY

Country/region code, based on international phone codes, also referred to as IBM country/region codes. The maximum number of characters allowed for this string is six, including a terminating null character.

Windows 10 added LOCALE\_IDIALINGCODE as a more accurately-named synonym for LOCALE\_ICOUNTRY. We encourage you to use the new name in order to improve code readability.

> [!Note]  
> International dialing codes are not unique to a particular country. For example, several countries, including the United States and Canada, use "1" as the international dialing code.
