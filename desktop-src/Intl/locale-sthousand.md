# LOCALE\_STHOUSAND

Characters that are used to separate groups of digits to the left of the decimal. The maximum number of characters allowed for this string is four, including a terminating null character. Typically, these groups represent thousands. However, depending on the value specified for [LOCALE\_SGROUPING](locale-sgrouping.md), they can represent something else.
