# LOCALE\_SMONTHDAY

**Windows 7 and later:** Format string for displaying only the month and the day. The formatting is similar to that defined for [LOCALE\_SLONGDATE](locale-slongdate.md). For example, if the month/day pattern is the full month name followed by the day number with leading zeros, as in "September 03", the format string is "MMMM dd". The string can consist of a combination of day and month format pictures and any string of characters enclosed in single quotes. Characters in single quotes remain as specified, for example, 'de' for Spanish (Spain). A locale can specify only one month/day format.
