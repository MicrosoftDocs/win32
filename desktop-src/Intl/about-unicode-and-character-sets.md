# About Unicode and Character Sets

The world's character-based data was developed using both [Unicode](unicode.md) and traditional character sets. Because of this, Windows provides character set functions that help applications convert the character-based data from its original character set to Unicode or another traditional character set. These character set functions also help applications create character-based data that can be transferred to and used on any operating system, including those that do not support Unicode.

For details about Unicode beyond the scope of this overview, see [The Unicode Standard](https://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html).

This section covers the following topics.

-   [Character Sets](character-sets.md)
-   [End-User-Defined and Private Use Area Characters](end-user-defined-characters.md)
-   [Unicode in the Windows API](unicode-in-the-windows-api.md)
