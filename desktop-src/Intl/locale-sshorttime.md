# LOCALE\_SSHORTTIME

**Windows 7 and later:** Short time formatting string for the locale. Patterns are typically derived by removing the "ss" (seconds) value from the long time format pattern. For example, if the long time format is "h:mm:ss tt", the short time format is most likely "h:mm tt". This constant can specify multiple formats in a semicolon-delimited list. However, the preferred short time format should be the first value listed.
