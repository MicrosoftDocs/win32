# About National Language Support

The National Language Support (NLS) functions permit applications to:

-   Set the locale for the user
-   Identify the language in which the user works
-   Retrieve strings representing times, dates, and other information formatted correctly for the specified language and locale

NLS also includes support for keyboard layouts and language-specific fonts. For more information, see [Input Method Manager](input-method-manager.md) and [International Fonts and Text Display](international-fonts-and-text-display.md).

The following topics are covered in this section:

-   [Date and Calendar](date-and-calendar.md)
