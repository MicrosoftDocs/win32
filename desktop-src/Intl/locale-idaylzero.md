# LOCALE\_IDAYLZERO

Specifier for leading zeros in day fields for a short date only. The maximum number of characters allowed for this string is two, including a terminating null character. It is preferred for your application to use the [LOCALE\_SSHORTDATE](locale-sshortdate.md) constant instead of LOCALE\_IDAYLZERO.



| Value | Meaning                   |
|-------|---------------------------|
| 0     | No leading zeros for days |
| 1     | Leading zeros for days    |
