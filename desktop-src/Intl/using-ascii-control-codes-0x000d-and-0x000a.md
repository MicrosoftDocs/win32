# Using ASCII Control Codes 0x000D and 0x000A

The Unicode standard does not prescribe specific meanings for the control codes 0x000D (carriage return) and 0x000A (linefeed). These codes are not required to be used in combination. If used individually, either code can represent itself only or both codes together. The application must always determine what these codes represent.
