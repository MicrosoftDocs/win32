# Candidate Lists

A candidate list is represented by a [**CANDIDATELIST**](/windows/win32/api/imm/ns-imm-candidatelist) structure containing an array of strings specifying the characters or character strings from which the user can choose. Your IME-aware application can retrieve candidate list information using the [**ImmGetCandidateListCount**](/windows/desktop/api/Imm/nf-imm-immgetcandidatelistcounta) and [**ImmGetCandidateList**](/windows/desktop/api/Imm/nf-imm-immgetcandidatelista) functions.
