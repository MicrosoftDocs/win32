# LOCALE\_IMONLZERO

Specifier for leading zeros in month fields for a short date only. It is preferred for your application to use the [LOCALE\_SSHORTDATE](locale-sshortdate.md) constant instead of LOCALE\_IMONLZERO.



| Value | Meaning                     |
|-------|-----------------------------|
| 0     | No leading zeros for months |
| 1     | Leading zeros for months    |
