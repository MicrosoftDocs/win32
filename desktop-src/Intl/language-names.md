# Language Names

A language name uses essentially the same formatting as a [locale name](locale-names.md). For example, the language name for the English (Belize) locale is "en-BZ". Each language name corresponds to a [language identifier](language-identifiers.md).

The main differences between formatting for a language name and formatting for a locale name are:

-   A language name never includes a sort order. Thus, the language name corresponding to the locale name "hu-HU\_technl" (Hungarian language, Hungary, with technical sort) is just "hu-HU".
-   A language name can be "neutral" with respect to locale. For example, "en" (English) is a valid neutral language name, as distinct from "en-BZ" (English, Belize).
