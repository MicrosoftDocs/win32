# LOCALE\_SKEYBOARDSTOINSTALL

**Windows Vista and later:** A semicolon-delimited list of keyboards to potentially install for the locale and to be used internally by Windows. There is no limit on the number of characters allowed for this string. To retrieve the name of the active input locale identifier (formerly called the keyboard layout), your application can call the [**GetKeyboardLayoutName**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getkeyboardlayoutnamea) function.
