# DDS

The DirectDraw Surface file format (.dds) was introduced with DirectX 7 to store uncompressed and compressed (DXTn) textures. The file format supports mipmaps, cube maps, and volume maps. The DDS file format is supported by [DirectXTex](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex), [DirectXTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTK), legacy D3DX, and other DirectX tools. Starting with Direct3D 10, DDS files support texture arrays.

> [!Note]  
> The D3DX (D3DX 9, D3DX 10, and [D3DX 11](/windows/desktop/direct3d11/d3d11-graphics-reference-d3dx11)) utility library is deprecated for Windows 8 and is not supported for Windows Store apps. We recommended that you make use of [DirectXTex](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex), [DirectXTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTK), or both.
