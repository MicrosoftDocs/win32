# DDS Volume Texture Example

For a volume texture, use the **DDSCAPS_COMPLEX**, **DDSCAPS2_VOLUME**, and **DDSD\_DEPTH flags**, and set *dwDepth*. A volume texture is an extension of a standard texture for Direct3D 9; a volume texture can be defined with or without mipmaps.

For volumes without mipmaps, each depth slice is written to the file in order. If mipmaps are included, all depth slices for a given mipmap level are written together, with each level containing half as many slices as the previous level with a minimum of 1.

For example, a 64-by-64-by-4 volume map using a pixel format of R8G8B8 (3 bytes per pixel) with all mipmap levels would contain the following:



| DDS Components                      | \# Bytes    |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| header                              | 128 bytes   |
| 64-by-64 slice 1 of 4 main image.   | 12288 bytes |
| 64-by-64 slice 2 of 4 main image.   | 12288 bytes |
| 64-by-64 slice 3 of 4 main image.   | 12288 bytes |
| 64-by-64 slice 4 of 4 main image.   | 12288 bytes |
| 32-by-32 slice 1 of 2 mipmap image. | 3072 bytes  |
| 32-by-32 slice 2 of 2 mipmap image. | 3072 bytes  |
| 16-by-16 slice 1 of 1 mipmap image. | 768 bytes   |
| 8-by-8 slice 1 of 1 mipmap image.   | 192 bytes   |
| 4-by-4 slice 1 of 1 mipmap image.   | 48 bytes    |
| 2-by-2 slice 1 of 1 mipmap image.   | 12 bytes    |
| 1-by-1 slice 1 of 1 mipmap image.   | 3 bytes     |



 

Note that the smallest mipmap level is only 3 bytes because the bitcount is 24 and there is no added compression at this level.

Support for volume textures was added in DirectX 8.
