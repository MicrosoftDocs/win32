After you create an INF file for the installation process, the setup functions can access that information to use when copying, deleting, or renaming files and updating INIs and registry entries.

The following topics describe how to use the setup functions to retrieve information from INF files and how to perform installation operations by referencing an INF file:

-   [Authoring an INF file](authoring-an-inf-file.md)
-   [Opening and Closing an INF file](opening-and-closing-an-inf-file.md)
-   [Retrieving Information From an INF File](retrieving-information-from-an-inf-file.md)
-   [Installing From an INF File](installing-from-an-inf-file.md)
