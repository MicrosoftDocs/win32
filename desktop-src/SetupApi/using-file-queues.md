# Using File Queues

The following sections describe how to use the setup functions to create a queue, add file operations to a queue, and commit the queue.

These sections also describe how the setup functions process the platform-specific sections of an INF file and how to override this functionality:

-   [Opening and Closing a Queue](opening-and-closing-a-queue.md)
-   [Queuing Files](queuing-files.md)
-   [Queuing an INF Section](queuing-an-inf-section.md)
-   [Committing a Queue](committing-a-queue.md)
-   [Platform Path Override](platform-path-override.md)
