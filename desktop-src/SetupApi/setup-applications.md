# Setup Applications

Typically, you create an *INF file* before authoring a setup application. An INF file is a text file that contains information used by your setup application during an installation. Examples of the information that may be stored in an INF file include INI and registry changes, filenames, and locations of the source files on source media.

After creating an INF file, you write the source code for your setup application. You can use the setup functions in your setup application to access the information in the INF file and perform installation operations.

The following sections describe the use of INF files and the setup processing functions:

-   [About INF Files](about-inf-files.md)
-   [Using INF Files](using-inf-files.md)
-   [INF File Setup Functions](inf-file-setup-functions.md)

For more information about using the setup functions in an application, see [Creating Setup Applications](creating-setup-applications.md).
