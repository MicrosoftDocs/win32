# About Cabinet Files

A cabinet is a single file, usually suffixed with .CAB, that stores compressed files in a file library. A compressed file can be spread over several cabinet files. During installation, the setup application decompresses the files stored in a cabinet and copies them to the user's system.

If cabinet files are used, the setup functions use the name of the cabinet as the tag file for the source disk it resides on.
