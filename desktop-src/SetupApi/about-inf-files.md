# About INF Files

An INF file is a text file divided into different types of formatted sections. Each section is designed for a particular purpose; for example, to copy files or to add entries to the registry. Number and type of sections in an INF file depends on the particular installation procedure. Each section consists of lines that contribute to that section's purpose.

INF files store information in a format that is described in the *General Guidelines for INF File* and *INF File Sections and Directives* sections of the Microsoft Windows 2000 Driver Development Kit. You should refer to these resources in the Microsoft Windows Driver Development Kit (DDK) if you plan to author INF files. The setup functions uses this format to retrieve information from the INF file

The following INF sections can be used with the setup functions to create an installation application. When you create an INF file, you do not have to include every type of section. The sections used depend on the installation procedure.



| Section                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The setup functions use this section to recognize for which version of Windows the INF file was intended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Each *strkey* in an INF file must specify a unique name consisting of printable characters. To include a % character in the string, use %%. The strkey must be defined in a **Strings** section of the INF file. You can use string keys as placeholders in an INF file for information that changes frequently or needs to be localized. |



 

An INF file can also contain private sections. The format of a private section depends on the setup application. Private sections in an INF file can be used to store specialized information used by a specific setup application. The Setup API includes functions, such as [**SetupGetLineText**](/windows/desktop/api/Setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupgetlinetexta)and [**SetupGetIntField**](/windows/desktop/api/Setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupgetintfield), that can retrieve information from the private sections of INF files at the level lines and fields within lines.
