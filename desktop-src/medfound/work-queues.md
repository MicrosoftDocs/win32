# Work Queues

In Microsoft Media Foundation, a work queue is an efficient way to perform asynchronous operations on another thread.

This section contains the following topics.




| Topic | Description | 
|-------|-------------|
| <a href="using-work-queues.md">Using Work Queues</a> | Describes how an application or component can use work queues to perform asynchronous operations. | 
| <a href="writing-an-asynchronous-method.md">Writing an Asynchronous Method</a> | Describes how to write an asynchronous method that follows the Begin/End pattern described in <a href="asynchronous-callback-methods.md">Asynchronous Callback Methods</a>. | 
| <a href="custom-asynchronous-result-objects.md">Custom Asynchronous Result Objects</a> | Describes how to create a custom implementation of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mfobjects/nn-mfobjects-imfasyncresult"><strong>IMFAsyncResult</strong></a> interface.<br /><blockquote>[!Note]<br />Most applications should use the stock implementation provided by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mfapi/nf-mfapi-mfcreateasyncresult"><strong>MFCreateAsyncResult</strong></a>. This topic is for applications with advanced requirements.</blockquote><br /> |
