# Saving and Loading Topologies

With TopoEdit, you can save a topology as an XML file and load it later on. When a full topology is loaded, it must be resolved again. For information about this procedure, see [Resolving a Topology with TopoEdit](resolving-a-topology-with-topoedit.md).

## To save a topology

1.  On the **File** menu, click **Save**.

    The **Save File** dialog box opens.

2.  Navigate to the folder where the topology file must be saved.

3.  In the **File name:** field, enter the name of the file.

4.  Click **Save**.

The topology file will be saved as an XML file.

## To load a saved topology

1.  On the **File** menu, click **Open**.

    The **Open File** dialog box opens.

2.  Navigate to the folder where the topology XML file is located.

3.  Specify the file name in the **File name:** field or select the file from the list.

4.  Click **Open**.

The topology file is loaded on the **Topology Pane**.
