# Controls Menu

The **Controls** menu provides transport control commands for a topology that is set on the Media Session. This menu is enabled only after a topology is resolved successfully. To access these commands quickly, you can use the [TopoEdit Toolbar](topoedit-toolbar.md).

The **Controls** menu provides the following commands:



| Command   | Description                                                              |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Play**  | Starts playback of the last resolved topology.                           |
| **Stop**  | Stops playback of the last resolved topology that is currently playing.  |
| **Pause** | Pauses playback of the last resolved topology that is currently playing. |
