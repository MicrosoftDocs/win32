# Introduction to TopoEdit

In Media Foundation, media data is processed through the pipeline layer and the Media Session controls the data flow and provides playback controls. Data in each pipeline component—source, transform, and sink—is represented as a *topology node*. The *topology object* is a collection of topology nodes and represents the entire path of data flow through the Media Session pipeline.

For information about topologies, see [About Topologies](about-topologies.md).

TopoEdit is a visual tool for building and testing topologies. With TopoEdit, you can perform the following tasks:

-   Build a topology by adding various topology nodes like source, transform, and output nodes.

-   Connect and resolve the topology.

-   Test the functionality of the topology through playback.
