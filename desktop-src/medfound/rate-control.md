# Rate Control

The [Media Session](media-session.md) supports changing the playback rate, which an application can use to implement playback features such as fast-forward and rewind. This section describes how applications can change the playback rate while using the Media Session.

For information about supporting rate control in your own pipeline components, see [Implementing Rate Control](implementing-rate-control.md).

This section contains the following topics.
