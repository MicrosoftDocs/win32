# TopoEdit Toolbar

By default, the toolbar is displayed across the top of the application window and below the menu bar. The toolbar provides quick mouse access to the [Controls Menu](controls-menu.md) items. The toolbar buttons are enabled only after a topology is resolved successfully.

The following screen shot shows the TopoEdit toolbar.
