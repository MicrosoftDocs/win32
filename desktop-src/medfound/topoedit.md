# TopoEdit

TopoEdit is a visual tool for building and testing topologies. With TopoEdit, you can perform the following tasks:

-   Build a topology by adding various topology nodes like source, transform, and output nodes.
-   Connect and resolve the topology structure.
-   Test the functionality of the topology through playback.

TopoEdit is available in the Windows SDK, starting with the Windows SDK for Windows Server 2008.
