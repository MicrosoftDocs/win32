# Adding Source Nodes with TopoEdit

A source node represents a stream in a media file. To create a source node in TopoEdit, you specify a media file. TopoEdit enumerates the streams in the file and creates the appropriate source nodes.

For information about adding source nodes programmatically by using Media Foundation APIs, see [Creating Source Nodes](creating-source-nodes.md).

## To add a source node to a topology

1.  On the **Topology** menu, click **Add Source**.

    The **Select Media Source** dialog box opens.

2.  Navigate to the folder where the media file is located.

3.  In the **File name:** field, enter the name of the file.

4.  Click **Open**.

TopoEdit creates source nodes for the streams. The **Topology Pane** shows the source node contained in a grey box that shows the name of the media file. The source node shows the stream type of the node.
