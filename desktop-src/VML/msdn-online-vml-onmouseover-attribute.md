This topic describes VML, a feature that is deprecated as of Windows Internet Explorer 9. Webpages and applications that rely on VML should be migrated to SVG or other widely supported standards.

Triggers a mouse event for a shape. Read/write. **String**.

**Applies To**

[Shape](shape-element--vml.md)

**Tag Syntax**

<v: *element* onmouseover=" *expression* ">

**Remarks**

A "mouseover" event is generated when the mouse pointer is on the shape. The value is generated by using the keyword **this** (as a reference to the object) followed by the object model syntax. For example, to change the fill color to red, use the following:

onmouseover="this.fillcolor='red'"

Note the use of single and double quotation marks to set off the expression.

*VML Standard Attribute*

**Example**

When the mouse pointer is on the shape, the fill color will turn from red to green.


```HTML
   <v:rect id=myrect fillcolor="red"
   style="position:relative;top:1;left:1;width:20;height:20"
   onmouseover='this.fillcolor="green"'>
   </v:rect>
```
