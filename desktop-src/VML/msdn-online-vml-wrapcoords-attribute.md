Defines the bounding polygon that surrounds a shape. Read/write. **String**.

**Applies To**

[Shape](shape-element--vml.md)

**Tag Syntax**

<v: *element* o:wrapcoords=" *expression* ">

**Remarks**

Describes a comma-delimited list of x and ycoordinates; that is, "x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,..." This is used when text is tightly wrapped around a shape. The default is **NULL** (an empty string) until the **MSO-Wrap-Mode** attribute is set to **tight** or **through**.

*Microsoft Office Extensions Attribute*

**Example**

The shape has a text wrap bounding box that is 5 units larger than the path.
