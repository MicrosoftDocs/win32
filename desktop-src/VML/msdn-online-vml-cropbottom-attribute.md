# VML CropBottom Attribute

This topic describes VML, a feature that is deprecated as of Windows Internet Explorer 9. Webpages and applications that rely on VML should be migrated to SVG or other widely supported standards.

Defines the percentage of picture removal from the bottom side. Read/write. **VgNumber**.

**Applies To**

[ImageData](msdn-online-vml-imagedata-element.md)

**Tag Syntax**

<v: *element* cropbottom=" *expression* ">

**Script Syntax**

*element* .cropbottom="*expression*"

*expression*=*element*.cropbottom

**Remarks**

The amount of cropping can range from -1.0 to 1.0. The default value is 0. Note that a value of 1 will display no picture at all. Negative values will result in the picture being squeezed inward from the edge being cropped (the empty space between the picture and the cropped edge will be filled by the fill color of the shape). Positive values less than 1 will result in the remaining picture being stretched to fit the shape.

VML Standard Attribute

**Example**

No image will be displayed because the image is 100% cropped from the bottom.


```HTML
   <v:shape id="rect01"
   coordorigin="0 0" coordsize="200 200"
   strokecolor="red"
   style="top:1;left:1;width:300;height:200"
   path="m 1,1 l 1,200, 200,200, 200,1 x e">
   <v:imagedata cropbottom="1" src="kids.jpg"/>
   </v:shape>
```
