Specifies the center position for polar handles. Read/write. **VgVector2D**.

**Applies To**

[H](msdn-online-vml-h-element.md) (subelement of [Handles](msdn-online-vml-handles-element.md))

**Tag Syntax**

<v: *element* polar=" *expression* ">

**Remarks**

The default value is a null string. If values are specified, this indicates that the measurement is polar and that the [Position](position-attribute--h--vml.md) attribute defines radius and angle values of the handle instead of x and y values.
