Predefined arc shape.

**Arc** uses the [startangle](msdn-online-vml-startangle-attribute.md) and [endangle](msdn-online-vml-endangle-attribute.md) attributes.

The following is the minimum code needed to produce an image.


```HTML
   <v:arc
   style="top:10;left:10;width:200;height:200"
   startangle="90" endangle="270">
   </v:arc>
```
