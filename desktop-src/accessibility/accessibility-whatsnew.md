## What's new for Windows 10 October 2018 Update (Version 1809)

The following features, tools, developer guidance, samples, and videos have been made available for the [Windows 10 October 2018 Update](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/10/02/how-to-get-the-windows-10-october-2018-update/#R6DJStjqlIkK34BT.97).

| Release | Platform | Feature | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1809 | Win32 | UI Automation supports Active Text Position Change events | UI Automation providers can explicitly set a starting position within a text range. Assistive technology (AT) clients can then convey this position to a user. For example, if a user clicks a link to an anchor on the same page (a bookmark link), the new location is provided to the AT. | [IUIAutomation6 interface](/windows/desktop/api/uiautomationclient/nn-uiautomationclient-iuiautomation6) |
| 1809 | Win32 | UI Automation supports event coalescing | Improves performance by attempting to detect, filter, and ignore duplicate sequential MSAA and UIA TextChanged events raised by some providers. | [IUIAutomation6 interface](/windows/desktop/api/uiautomationclient/nn-uiautomationclient-iuiautomation6) |
| 1809 | Win32 | UI Automation supports connection recovery behavior | Messages from a UI Automation client to a provider are suspended (for two seconds, by default) if the provider is non-responsive. This reduces the frequency of extended timeouts, and minimizes flooding a non-responsive provider with events and requests. | [IUIAutomation6 interface](/windows/desktop/api/uiautomationclient/nn-uiautomationclient-iuiautomation6) |
| 1809 | UWP | Enhanced screen reader services | AT clients know the audible screen reading location (control or content) and the reading mode. | [ScreenReaderService Class](/uwp/api/windows.ui.accessibility.screenreaderservice) |
| 1809 | Win32, UWP | UI Automation supports dialog windows | UI Automation providers can mark UIA elements specifically as dialog windows. ATs often present dialogs differently to users. | [IUIAutomationElement9](/windows/desktop/api/UIAutomationClient/nn-uiautomationclient-iuiautomationelement9)<br/><br/>[ContentDialog Class](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.contentdialog) |
| 1809 |  UWP | Text scaling  | Scales text size in applications and web pages. | [UISettings.TextScaleFactorChanged Event](/uwp/api/windows.ui.viewmanagement.uisettings.textscalefactorchanged)<br/><br/>[Text scaling](/windows/uwp/design/input/text-scaling) |
