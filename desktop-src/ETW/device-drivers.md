# Device Drivers

This documentation is for user-mode applications that want to use ETW for event tracing. This documentation is not for device drivers that run in kernel-mode. For those writing device drivers and kernel-mode applications that want to use ETW as a low-impact debugger to troubleshoot timing-related problems, see [Event Tracing for Windows](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/event-tracing-for-windows--etw-), [WPP Software Tracing](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/wpp-software-tracing), and [WMI Event Tracing](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/wmi-event-tracing) in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for information on instrumenting your driver.
