# Retrieving Event Data Using TDH

To consume event specific data, the consumer must know the format of the event data. If the provider used TraceLogging, a manifest, MOF, or TMF files to publish the format of the event data, you can use the trace data helper (TDH) functions to parse the event data. The TDH functions are available beginning with WindowsÂ Vista.

The following topics show you how to use TDH to retrieve event data and metadata.
