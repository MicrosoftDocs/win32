# Advantages of Role-based Authorization

The Authorization Manager API provides an authorization model that has several advantages over low-level (ACL-based) authorization:

-   Simplifies access control administration.
-   Makes authorization available to scripts and applications developed using the Microsoft Visual Basic development system.
-   Provides a mechanism to apply run-time business logic when checking access.
