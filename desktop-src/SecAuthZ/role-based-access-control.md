# Role-based Access Control

The Authorization Manager API and MMC snap-in provide applications with a role-based access control framework. The Authorization Manager API, also known as AzMan, provides a simplified development model in which to manage flexible groups and business rules and store authorization policies. For more information, see the following topics:

-   [Advantages of Role-based Authorization](advantages-of-role-based-authorization.md)
-   [Authorization Manager Model](authorization-manager-model.md)

**Windows XP:** The Authorization Manager API and MMC snap-in are available as a download (Windows Server 2003 Administration Tools Pack) from [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=83468). This download supports administration and development of Authorization Manager policies; it does not support deployment of applications that use Authorization Manager to control access.
