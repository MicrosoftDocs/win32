# Well-known SIDs

Well-known [*security identifiers*](/windows/win32/SecGloss/s-gly) (SIDs) identify generic groups and generic users. For example, there are well-known SIDs to identify the following groups and users:

- Everyone or World, which is a group that includes all users.
- CREATOR\_OWNER, which is used as a placeholder in an inheritable ACE. When the ACE is inherited, the system replaces the CREATOR\_OWNER SID with the SID of the object's creator.
- The Administrators group for the built-in domain on the local computer.

There are [*universal well-known SIDs*](/windows/win32/SecGloss/u-gly), which are meaningful on all secure systems using this security model, including operating systems other than Windows. In addition, there are well-known SIDs that are meaningful only on Windows systems.

The Windows API defines a set of constants for well-known identifier authority and [*relative identifier*](/windows/win32/SecGloss/r-gly) (RID) values. You can use these constants to create well-known SIDs. The following example combines the SECURITY\_WORLD\_SID\_AUTHORITY and SECURITY\_WORLD\_RID constants to show the universal well-known SID for the special group representing all users (Everyone or World):

`S-1-1-0`

This example uses the string notation for SIDs in which S identifies the string as a SID, the first 1 is the revision level of the SID, and the remaining two digits are the SECURITY\_WORLD\_SID\_AUTHORITY and SECURITY\_WORLD\_RID constants.

You can use the [**AllocateAndInitializeSid**](/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-allocateandinitializesid) function to build a SID by combining an identifier authority value with up to eight subauthority values. For example, to determine whether the logged-on user is a member of a particular well-known group, call **AllocateAndInitializeSid** to build a SID for the well-known group and use the [**EqualSid**](/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-equalsid) function to compare that SID to the group SIDs in the user's [*access token*](/windows/win32/SecGloss/a-gly). For an example, see [Searching for a SID in an Access Token in C++](searching-for-a-sid-in-an-access-token-in-c--.md). You must call the [**FreeSid**](/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-freesid) function to free a SID allocated by **AllocateAndInitializeSid**.

The remainder of this section contains tables of well-known SIDs and tables of identifier authority and subauthority constants that you can use to build well-known SIDs.

The following are some [*universal well-known SIDs*](/windows/win32/SecGloss/u-gly).

| Universal well-known SID | Identifies |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Null SID<br/>String value: `S-1-0-0` | A group with no members. This is often used when a SID value is not known. |
| World<br/>String value: `S-1-1-0` | A group that includes all users. |
| Local<br/>String value: `S-1-2-0` | Users who log on to [*terminals*](/windows/win32/SecGloss/t-gly) locally (physically) connected to the system. |
| Creator Owner ID<br/>String value: `S-1-3-0` | A security identifier to be replaced by the security identifier of the user who created a new object. This SID is used in inheritable ACEs. |
| Creator Group ID<br/>String value: `S-1-3-1` | A security identifier to be replaced by the primary-group SID of the user who created a new object. Use this SID in inheritable ACEs. |

The following table lists the predefined identifier authority constants. The first four values are used with universal well-known SIDs; the last value is used with Windows well-known SIDs.

| Identifier authority | Value | String value |
|----------------------|-------|--------------|
| SECURITY_NULL_SID_AUTHORITY | `0` | `S-1-0` |
| SECURITY_WORLD_SID_AUTHORITY | `1` | `S-1-1` |
| SECURITY_LOCAL_SID_AUTHORITY | `2` | `S-1-2` |
| SECURITY_CREATOR_SID_AUTHORITY | `3` | `S-1-3` |
| SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY | `5` | `S-1-5` |

The following [*RID*](/windows/win32/SecGloss/r-gly) values are used with [*universal well-known SIDs*](/windows/win32/SecGloss/u-gly). The Identifier authority column shows the prefix of the identifier authority with which you can combine the RID to create a universal well-known SID.

| Relative identifier authority | Value | String value |
|-------------------------------|-------|--------------|
| SECURITY_NULL_RID          | `0` | `S-1-0` |
| SECURITY_WORLD_RID         | `0` | `S-1-1` |
| SECURITY_LOCAL_RID         | `0` | `S-1-2` |
| SECURITY_LOCAL_LOGON_RID   | `1` | `S-1-2` |
| SECURITY_CREATOR_OWNER_RID | `0` | `S-1-3` |
| SECURITY_CREATOR_GROUP_RID | `1` | `S-1-3` |

The SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY (S-1-5) predefined identifier authority produces SIDs that are not universal but are meaningful only on Windows installations. You can use the following RID values with SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY to create well-known SIDs.

| Constant | Identifies |
|----------|------------|
| SECURITY_DIALUP_RID<br/>String value: `S-1-5-1` | Users who log on to [*terminals*](/windows/win32/SecGloss/t-gly) using a dial-up modem. This is a group identifier. |
| SECURITY_NETWORK_RID<br/>String value: `S-1-5-2` | Users who log on across a network. This is a group identifier added to the token of a process when it was logged on across a network. The corresponding logon type is LOGON32_LOGON_NETWORK. |
| SECURITY_BATCH_RID<br/>String value: `S-1-5-3` | Users who log on using a batch queue facility. This is a group identifier added to the token of a process when it was logged as a batch job. The corresponding logon type is LOGON32_LOGON_BATCH. |
| SECURITY_INTERACTIVE_RID<br/>String value: `S-1-5-4` | Users who log on for interactive operation. This is a group identifier added to the token of a process when it was logged on interactively. The corresponding logon type is LOGON32_LOGON_INTERACTIVE. |
| SECURITY_LOGON_IDS_RID<br/>String value: `S-1-5-5-*X*-*Y*` | A logon session. This is used to ensure that only [*processes*](/windows/win32/SecGloss/p-gly) in a given logon session can gain access to the window-station objects for that session. The *X* and *Y* values for these SIDs are different for each logon session. The value SECURITY_LOGON_IDS_RID_COUNT is the number of RIDs in this identifier (5-*X*-*Y*). |
| SECURITY_SERVICE_RID<br/>String value: `S-1-5-6` | Accounts authorized to log on as a service. This is a group identifier added to the token of a process when it was logged as a service. The corresponding logon type is LOGON32_LOGON_SERVICE. |
| SECURITY_ANONYMOUS_LOGON_RID<br/>String value: `S-1-5-7` | Anonymous logon, or null session logon. |
| SECURITY_PROXY_RID<br/>String value: `S-1-5-8` | Proxy. |
| SECURITY_ENTERPRISE_CONTROLLERS_RID<br/>String value: `S-1-5-9` | Enterprise controllers. |
| SECURITY_PRINCIPAL_SELF_RID<br/>String value: `S-1-5-10` | The PRINCIPAL_SELF security identifier can be used in the ACL of a user or group object. During an access check, the system replaces the SID with the SID of the object. The PRINCIPAL_SELF SID is useful for specifying an inheritable ACE that applies to the user or group object that inherits the ACE. It the only way of representing the SID of a created object in the default [*security descriptor*](/windows/win32/SecGloss/s-gly) of the schema. |
| SECURITY_AUTHENTICATED_USER_RID<br/>String value: `S-1-5-11` | The authenticated users. |
| SECURITY_RESTRICTED_CODE_RID<br/>String value: `S-1-5-12` | Restricted code. |
| SECURITY_TERMINAL_SERVER_RID<br/>String value: `S-1-5-13` | Terminal Services. Automatically added to the security token of a user who logs on to a terminal server. |
| SECURITY_LOCAL_SYSTEM_RID<br/>String value: `S-1-5-18` | A special account used by the operating system. |

The [WELL_KNOWN_SID_TYPE](/windows/win32/api/Winnt/ne-winnt-well_known_sid_type) enumeration defines the list of commonly used SIDs. Additionally, the [Security Descriptor Definition Language](security-descriptor-definition-language.md) (SDDL) uses [SID strings](sid-strings.md) to reference well-known SIDs in a string format.
