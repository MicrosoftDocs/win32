# Order of ACEs in a DACL

When a [*process*](/windows/desktop/SecGloss/p-gly) tries to access a securable object, the system steps through the [*access control entries*](/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly) (ACEs) in the object's [*discretionary access control list*](/windows/desktop/SecGloss/d-gly) (DACL) until it finds ACEs that allow or deny the requested access. The access rights that a DACL allows a user could vary depending on the order of ACEs in the DACL. Consequently, the Windows XP operating system defines a preferred order for ACEs in the DACL of a securable object. The preferred order provides a simple framework that ensures that an access-denied ACE actually denies access. For more information about the system's algorithm for checking access, see [How DACLs Control Access to an Object](how-dacls-control-access-to-an-object.md).

For Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP, the proper order of ACEs is complicated by the introduction of object-specific ACEs and automatic inheritance.

The following steps describe the preferred order:

1.  All explicit ACEs are placed in a group before any inherited ACEs.
2.  Within the group of explicit ACEs, access-denied ACEs are placed before access-allowed ACEs.
3.  Inherited ACEs are placed in the order in which they are inherited. ACEs inherited from the child object's parent come first, then ACEs inherited from the grandparent, and so on up the tree of objects.
4.  For each level of inherited ACEs, access-denied ACEs are placed before access-allowed ACEs.

Of course, not all ACE types are required in an ACL.

Functions such as [**AddAccessAllowedAceEx**](/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-addaccessallowedaceex) and [**AddAccessAllowedObjectAce**](/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-addaccessallowedobjectace) add an ACE to the end of an ACL. It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the ACEs are added in the proper order.
