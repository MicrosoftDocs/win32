# Primary Group of a New Object

A new object's primary group is the primary group from the [*security descriptor*](/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly) specified by the object's creator. If an object's creator does not specify a primary group, the object's primary group is the default primary group from the creator's primary or [*impersonation token*](/windows/desktop/SecGloss/i-gly).
