# Allowing Anonymous Access

The default security policy restricts anonymous local access to having no rights. Administrators can then add or subtract rights as they see fit.

A local access group exists for applications with the same access rights as Everyone. Administrators can then appropriately increase or decrease the number of users in that group, named the **Pre-Windows 2000-Compatible Access Group**.

For more information, see the reference pages for the functions listed in the table of the [Local Group Functions](/windows/desktop/NetMgmt/local-group-functions) topic.
