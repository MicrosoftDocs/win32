# Permissions Property Page

The **Permissions** property page contains controls for advanced editing of the [*ACEs*](/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly) in an object's [*DACL*](/windows/desktop/SecGloss/d-gly). This page enables the user to view and edit all of the information in the DACL, including information that is not available on the [basic security property page](basic-security-property-page.md). The advanced information includes [object-specific ACEs](object-specific-aces.md) and information about [ACE inheritance](ace-inheritance.md).

The **Permissions** property page is always included in the [advanced security property sheet](advanced-security-property-sheet.md) displayed when the user clicks the **Advanced** button on the basic security property page.
