# Authorization

## Purpose

Authorization is the right granted an individual to use the system and the data stored on it. Authorization is typically set up by a system administrator and verified by the computer based on some form of user identification, such as a code number or password.

Microsoft authorization technologies include Authorization Manager and the Authz API.

## Developer audience

Microsoft authorization technologies are intended for use by developers of applications based on the Windows Server and Windows operating systems that control access to resources. Developers should be familiar with Windows-based programming. Although not required, an understanding of authorization or security-related subjects is advised.

## Run-time requirements
