# Running the Application

To run the application on a single computer, open two console windows. In the first window, type

**hellos**

and in the second window, type

**helloc**

To experiment with different protocol sequences, endpoints, and other options, build the sample hello application from the source files in the RPC\\Hello directory in the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK).

> **RPC Interface Restriction** may cause this application to fail with an **Access denied** error on Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2) and later versions of Windows. For more information, see [RPC Interface Restriction](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-xp/bb457156(v=technet.10)#EGAA).
