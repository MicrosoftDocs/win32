# The type\_UserFree Function

The **<type>\_UserFree** function is a helper function for the \[ [wire\_marshal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa367309)\] and \[ [user\_marshal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa367296)\] attributes. The stubs call this function to free the data on the server side. The function is defined as:

``` syntax
void __RPC_USER  <type>_UserFree(
    unsigned long __RPC_FAR * pFlags,
    <type_name>  __RPC_FAR *  pMyObj );
```

The <type> in the function name means the userm-type specified in the **\[wire\_marshal\]** or **\[user\_marshal\]** type definition.

The *pFlags* parameter is a pointer to an **unsigned long** flag field. The upper word of the flag contains NDR data representation flags as defined by OSF DCE for floating point, byte order, and character representations. The lower word contains a marshaling context flag as defined by the COM channel. The exact layout of the flags within the field is described in [The type\_UserSize Function](the-type-usersize-function.md).

The *pMyObj* parameter is a pointer to a user type object. The NDR engine frees the top-level object. You are responsible for freeing any objects to which the top-level object may point.

Exceptions must be caught and handled locally, exceptions must not be allowed to propigated up the call stack.
