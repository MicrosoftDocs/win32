# Building RPC Applications

The procedure for building a distributed remote procedure call (RPC) application varies slightly, depending on:

-   The operating system platform on which you are developing.
-   The target platform.
-   The version of the MIDL and C or C++ compiler you use.
-   The API libraries you use.

This section discusses the process of building client/server applications with Microsoft Remote Procedure Call. It presents the information in the following topics:

-   [General Build Procedure](general-build-procedure.md)
-   [Exception Handling](exception-handling.md)
