# Asynchronous DCOM

To take advantage of asynchronous RPC transparently, COM programmers can use the Async\* interfaces generated by the MIDL compiler as described in the MIDL attribute topic, [**async\_uuid**](../midl/async-uuid.md). For more information, please see [COM Clients and Servers](../com/com-clients-and-servers.md),[Making and Processing Asynchronous Calls](../com/making-and-processing-asynchronous-calls.md), and [Asynchronous Method Calls in COM Clients and Servers](/archive/msdn-magazine/2000/april/windows-2000-asynchronous-method-calls-eliminate-the-wait-for-com-clients-and-servers).
