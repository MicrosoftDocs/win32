# Authentication Services

The Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) provides the underlying authentication services for RPC. Therefore, when your application specifies an authentication service, it selects an SSP. For a list of the SSPs that SPPI currently supports, see [Authentication-Service Constants](authentication-service-constants.md). For more information, see [Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI)](security-support-provider-interface-sspi-.md).

> [!Note]  
> The terms Security Provider and Authentication Service are interchangeable.
