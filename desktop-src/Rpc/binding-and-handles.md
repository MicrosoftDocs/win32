# Binding and Handles

This section explains creating and using bindings and binding handles between client and server programs. It also discusses client/server contexts and context handles. The information is divided into the following topics:

-   [Binding Handles](binding-handles.md)
-   [Context Handles](context-handles.md)

In addition to binding and context handles, Microsoft RPC also supports serialization handles used to encode or decode data. These are used for serialization on a local computer and do not involve remote binding. For more information, see [Serialization Services](serialization-services.md).
