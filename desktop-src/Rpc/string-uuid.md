# String UUID

A string UUID contains the character-array representation of a UUID. A string UUID is composed of multiple fields of hexadecimal characters. Each member has a fixed length, and fields are separated by the hyphen character. For example:

`989C6E5C-2CC1-11CA-A044-08002B1BB4F5`

When providing a string UUID as an input parameter to an RPC run-time function, enter the alphabetic hexadecimal characters as either uppercase or lowercase characters. However, when a run-time function returns a string UUID, the hexadecimal characters are always lowercase.
