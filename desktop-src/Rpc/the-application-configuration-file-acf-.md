# The Application Configuration File (ACF)

The application configuration file (ACF) has two parts: an [interface header](the-acf-header.md), similar to the interface header in the IDL file, and a [body](the-acf-body.md), which contains configuration attributes that apply to types and functions defined in the interface body of the IDL file. These are discussed in the following topics:

-   [The ACF Header](the-acf-header.md)
-   [The ACF Body](the-acf-body.md)
