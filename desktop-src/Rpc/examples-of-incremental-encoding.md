# Examples of Incremental Encoding

The following section provides an example of how to use the incremental style serializing handle for type encoding.

``` syntax
/* This is an acf file. MooType is defined in the idl file */

[    explicit_handle
]
interface regress
{
typedef [ encode,decode ] MooType;
}
```

The following excerpt represents the relevant application fragments.


```C++
if (MesEncodeIncrementalHandleCreate (State, AllocFn, WriteFn, 
    &Handle) == RPC_S_OK)
{
//...
/* The serialize works from the beginning of the buffer because
    the handle is in the initial state. The Moo_Encode does the
    following:
    - sizes *pMooObject for marshalling,
    - calls AllocFn with the size obtained,
    - marshalls into the buffer returned by Alloc, and
    - calls WriteFn with the filled buffer 
*/

Moo_Encode ( Handle, pMooObject );
...
}
if (MesIncrementalHandleReset (Handle, NULL, NULL, NULL, ReadFn,
    MES_DECODE ) == RPC_OK)
{
/*The ReadFn is needed to reset the handle. The arguments
    that are NULL do not change. You can also call 
    MesDecodeIncrementalHandleCreate (State, ReadFn, &Handle);
    The Moo_Decode does the following:
    - calls Read with the appropriate size of data to read and
        receives a buffer with the data
    - unmarshalls the object from the buffer into *pMooObject 
*/

Moo_Decode ( Handle, pMooObject );
//...
MesHandleFree ( Handle );
}
```
