# Using Asynchronous RPC with DCE Pipes

Microsoft RPC supports the use of DCE pipes. Although they share a similar name, DCE pipes are unrelated to [named pipes](asynchronous-rpc-over-the-named-pipe-protocol.md). Named pipes are a transport protocol. DCE pipes are a protocol-independent method of client/server communication.

This section presents a discussion of RPC using asynchronous DCE pipes. It is divided into the following topics:

-   [Asynchronous Pipes](asynchronous-pipes.md)
-   [Declaring Asynchronous Pipes](declaring-asynchronous-pipes.md)
-   [Client-side Asynchronous Pipe Handling](client-side-asynchronous-pipe-handling.md)
-   [Server-side Asynchronous Pipe Handling](server-side-asynchronous-pipe-handling.md)

For a sample asynchronous pipe RPC application, see the FileRep sample in the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK).
