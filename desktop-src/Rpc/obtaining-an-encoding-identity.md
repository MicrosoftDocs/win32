# Obtaining an Encoding Identity

An application that is decoding encoded data can obtain the identity of the routine used to encode the data, prior to calling a routine to decode it. The [**MesInqProcEncodingId**](/windows/win32/Midles/nf-midles-mesinqprocencodingid?branch=master) routine provides this identity.

Each procedure in an interface is assigned an integer identification number, called a *procedure identifier* or a *proc ID*, by the MIDL compiler. Numbering begins with zero. The RPC run-time libraries are not involved in translating the procedure ID into an actual procedure call. Given a proc ID, your application must provide a means of calling the correct procedure. Typically, application developers use a series of **if** statements, or (when using C/C++) a **switch** statement for this purpose.
