# Configuring the Name Service for Windows 95

Windows 95 does not use Microsoft Locator. In order to use a name service in a Windows 95 application, the computer with Windows 95 must either:

-   Be part of a workgroup or domain that includes a computer running Windows 2000 or Windows NT to serve as a proxy name service provider.
-   Be connected to a host computer running the NSI daemon (nsid), which serves as a gateway to the Digital Equipment Corporation DCE Cell Directory Service.
