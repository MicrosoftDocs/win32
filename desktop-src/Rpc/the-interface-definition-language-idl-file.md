# The Interface Definition Language (IDL) File

An IDL file contains one or more interface definitions. Each interface definition is composed of an interface header and an interface body. The interface header is demarcated by square brackets. The interface body is contained in curly brackets. This is illustrated in the following example interface:

``` syntax
[
  /*Interface attributes go here. */
]
interface INTERFACENAME
{
  /*The interface body goes here. */
}
```

This section gives an overview of the components of an interface. It is organized into the following topics:

-   [The IDL Interface Header](the-idl-interface-header.md)
-   [The IDL Interface Body](the-idl-interface-body.md)
