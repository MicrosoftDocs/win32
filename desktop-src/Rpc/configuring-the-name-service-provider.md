# Configuring the Name Service Provider

If your distributed application registers its interface with a name service, both the client and server must be using the same name service. Microsoft RPC interoperates with Microsoft Locator and any name service provider (NSP) that adheres to the Microsoft RPC name service interface (NSI)—for example, the DCE Cell Directory Service accessed through Digital Equipment Corporation's name service daemon (NSID). Microsoft Locator, which is designed for use in Windows environments, is the default name service provider.
