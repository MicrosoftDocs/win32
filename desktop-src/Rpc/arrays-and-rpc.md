# Arrays and RPC

The C and C++ programming languages provide essentially two types of arrays: single-dimensional and multidimensional. RPC enables developers to specify additional array types using MIDL attributes to describe the characteristics of arrays in distributed applications.

This section describes the types of arrays available under RPC. It also discusses the MIDL attributes that developers can use to describe single-dimensional and multidimensional arrays. This material is presented in the following topics:

-   [Kinds of Arrays](kinds-of-arrays.md)
-   [Array Attributes](array-attributes.md)
-   [Multidimensional Arrays](multidimensional-arrays.md)
