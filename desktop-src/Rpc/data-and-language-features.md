# Data and Language Features

The Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL) provides the set of features that extend the C programming language to support remote procedure calls. MIDL is not a variation of C; it is a strongly typed formal language through which you can control the data transmitted over a network. MIDL is designed so that developers familiar with C can learn it quickly.

This topic discusses three language features:

-   [Strong Typing](strong-typing.md)
-   [Directional (Parameter) Attributes](directional-parameter-attributes.md)
-   [Data Representation](data-representation.md)
