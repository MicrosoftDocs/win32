# How Secure is My RPC Server Now?

Following the security outlined in this section, provided elsewhere in the RPC SDK, and generally accepted as proper security practices, will result in a server that is very secure. Such servers are protected from penetration attacks or privacy breaches.

If state is kept between RPC calls, make sure a single client does not cause the allocation of excessive resources, which could potentially deny service to other clients.
