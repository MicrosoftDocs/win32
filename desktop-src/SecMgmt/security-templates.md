# Security Templates

The Security Templates is a standalone snap-in tool that users can use to define computer-independent security configurations. These configurations are saved as text-based .inf files.

The Security Templates and the [Security Configuration and Analysis](security-configuration-and-analysis.md) make up the Security Configuration snap-ins.
