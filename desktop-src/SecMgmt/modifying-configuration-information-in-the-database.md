# Modifying Configuration Information in the Database

The attachment snap-in extension must enable users to change configuration information through its analysis node. This allows users to make changes and then re-apply the configuration over time. The logic to do this should be identical to modifying information in the configuration files. The changes made will take effect on the saved configuration in the security database.
