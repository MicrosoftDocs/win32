# Security Configuration and Analysis

The Security Configuration and Analysis is a stand-alone snap-in tool that users can use to import one or more saved configurations to a private security database. Importing configurations builds a machine-specific security database that stores a composite configuration. You can apply this composite configuration to the computer and analyze the current system configuration against the stored composite configuration stored in the database.

The [Security Templates](security-templates.md) and the Security Configuration and Analysis make up the Security Configuration snap-ins.
