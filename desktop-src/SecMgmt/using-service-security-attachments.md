# Using Service Security Attachments

This section describes how to create the attachment components required to support a service-specific configuration in the Security Configuration snap-ins. You will need to implement and register two components: an extension snap-in to display a user interface and an attachment engine to process configuration and analysis requests.

For more information see the following topics:
