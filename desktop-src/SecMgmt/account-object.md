# Account Object

The **Account** object is used to assign [*privileges*](/windows/desktop/SecGloss/p-gly), system access, and special quotas to individual users or to members of local groups or groups.

The information stored in an **Account** object includes:

-   The SID of a user account, group account, or local group account.
-   A list of privileges to be assigned to the user or the members of a group. If a user is assigned privileges by several **Account** objects, the list includes all assigned privileges.
