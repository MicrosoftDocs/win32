# Extensible Authentication Protocol Host

## Purpose

EAPHost is a Microsoft Windows Networking component that provides an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) infrastructure for the authentication of "supplicant" protocol implementations such as [802.1X](/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ms890287(v=msdn.10)). It also allows for authentication with "authenticator" technologies such as the Microsoft Network Policy Server (NPS) and other third-party servers.

The EAPHost APIs enable applications to authenticate using the EAPHost service, and provide a template for the development of conformant authentication methods for use with EAPHost.

## Run-time requirements

The EAPHost APIs are supported only in WindowsÂ Vista and later operating systems.
