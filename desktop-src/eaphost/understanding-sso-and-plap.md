# SSO and PLAP

The Single Sign-On (SSO) API represents a set of methods used to obtain EAP method specific credentials for a network user or computer account in a secure fashion without having to raise multiple UI instances.

> [!Note]  
> The term Pre-Logon Access Provider (PLAP) is obsolete. If "Pre-Logon Access Provider" or "PLAP" is encountered in code or documentation, replace it with "Single Sign-On" or "SSO" respectively.
