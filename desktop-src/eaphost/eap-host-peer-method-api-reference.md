# EAPHost Peer Method API Reference

The EAPHost Peer Method API documentation consists of the following sections.

-   [EAPHost Peer Method Configuration Functions](eaphost-peer-method-configuration-functions.md)
-   [EAPHost Peer Method Run-Time Functions](eaphost-peer-method-run-time-functions.md)
-   [EAPHost Peer Method Enumerations](eap-host-peer-method-enumerations.md)
-   [EAPHost Peer Method Structures](eap-host-peer-method-structures.md)

Note that these elements must be implemented in a conformant DLL by the author of the EAP peer method. The DLL with the implementation of these API elements is loaded and called by the client-side EAPHost.
