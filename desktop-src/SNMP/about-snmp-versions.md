# About SNMP Versions

The original Internet standard Network Management Framework, described in RFCs 1155, 1157, and 1213, is called the SNMP version 1 (SNMPv1) framework. Relevant portions of the proposed framework for version 2C of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2C) are described in RFCs 1901 through 1908.

The WinSNMP API supports the SNMP protocol functionality described in the relevant Internet RFCs. WinSNMP places no constraints on the use of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2C by WinSNMP applications.

A management entity can support a different version of SNMP than the one the WinSNMP application supports. The Microsoft WinSNMP implementation performs the appropriate translations from SNMPv1 to SNMPv2C in accordance with the relevant RFC.
