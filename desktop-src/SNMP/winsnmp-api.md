# WinSNMP API

\[SNMP is available for use in the operating systems specified in the Requirements section. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use [Windows Remote Management](/windows/desktop/WinRM/portal), which is the Microsoft implementation of WS-Man.\]

The Microsoft Windows SNMP Application Programming Interface (the WinSNMP API) versions 1.1a and 2.0 allow you to develop SNMP-based network management applications that execute in the Windows environment. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a request-response protocol that transfers management information between protocol entities.

WinSNMP has been jointly developed with the cooperation, input, and support from several companies, associations and individuals.

The first part of this overview provides information about the WinSNMP 2.0 Addendum, SNMP versions, and a list of the relevant Requests for Comments (RFCs). It also describes the WinSNMP model, and the components and features of the Microsoft WinSNMP implementation. It also provides information about data management and communications concepts you need to program in the WinSNMP environment.

The second section discusses the WinSNMP functions and the following related WinSNMP programming tasks:

-   [Opening and closing a WinSNMP application](opening-and-closing-a-winsnmp-application.md)
-   [Opening and closing a WinSNMP session](opening-and-closing-a-winsnmp-session.md)
-   [Managing traps and notifications](managing-traps-and-notifications.md)
-   [Working with variable binding lists](working-with-variable-binding-lists.md)
-   [Working with protocol data units](working-with-protocol-data-units.md)
-   [Sending SNMP messages](sending-snmp-messages.md)
-   [Receiving SNMP messages](receiving-snmp-messages.md)
-   [Managing object identifiers](managing-object-identifiers.md)
-   [Freeing WinSNMP descriptors](freeing-winsnmp-descriptors.md)
-   [Setting the entity and context translation mode](setting-the-entity-and-context-translation-mode.md)
-   [Managing the retransmission policy](managing-the-retransmission-policy.md)
-   [Writing WinSNMP applications with multiple threads](writing-winsnmp-applications-with-multiple-threads.md)
-   [Registering an SNMP agent application](registering-an-snmp-agent-application.md)

You should be familiar with the basic concepts of SNMP and Windows programming before reading this overview. For more information about SNMP, see [Simple Network Management Protocol](simple-network-management-protocol-snmp-.md) and the relevant Requests for Comments (RFCs) which are published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
