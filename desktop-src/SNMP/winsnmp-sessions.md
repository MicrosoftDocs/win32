# WinSNMP Sessions

A *session* is the basic unit of resource and communications management between a calling WinSNMP application and the Microsoft WinSNMP implementation. It is recommended that an application use sessions to organize its operations and reduce the demand on the implementation's resources.

For more information, see [Opening and Closing a WinSNMP Session](opening-and-closing-a-winsnmp-session.md).
