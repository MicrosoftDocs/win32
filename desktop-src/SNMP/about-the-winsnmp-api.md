# About the WinSNMP API

\[SNMP is available for use in the operating systems specified in the Requirements section. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use [Windows Remote Management](/windows/desktop/WinRM/portal), which is the Microsoft implementation of WS-Man.\]

The WinSNMP API is an interface for the development of SNMP-enabled network management applications.

The WinSNMP API provides the following features:

-   SNMP-enabling technology for network management applications
-   SNMP version 1 (SNMPv1) and SNMP version 2C (SNMPv2C) support

In addition to SNMP manager operations, WinSNMP API version 2.0 also supports SNMP agent operations.

The WinSNMP API supports 32-bit applications, and it executes in single- and multi-threaded environments. Support for the WinSNMP API is available for applications that execute in the Windows 2000 operating environment or later.
