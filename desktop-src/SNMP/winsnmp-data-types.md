# WinSNMP Data Types

\[SNMP is available for use in the operating systems specified in the Requirements section. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use [Windows Remote Management](/windows/desktop/WinRM/portal), which is the Microsoft implementation of WS-Man.\]

The standard WinSNMP data types are defined in the WINSNMP.H file.

Note that WinSNMP specifies some parameters with the signed long integer type, **smiINT**. This enables WinSNMP to comply with the data elements, especially the PDU components, defined in the relevant RFCs.
