# About the WinSNMP 2.0 Addendum

The WinSNMP version 2.0 Addendum is an update to the WinSNMP Manager API specification, version 1.1a. (At this time no specification defines version 2.0 of the WinSNMP API.) The Addendum was jointly developed with the cooperation, input, and support from several companies, associations, and individuals.

The WinSNMP 1.1a specification defines the WinSNMP Manager application programming interface for developing SNMP-based network management applications. In the WinSNMP version 2.0 Addendum, the interface is renamed as the WinSNMP API. This is because WinSNMP 2.0 supports both agent and manager SNMP operations. You should be familiar with both documents if you are programming in the WinSNMP environment.

The Microsoft WinSNMP implementation is compliant with WinSNMP 2.0. It supports all the functions and operations defined in both the WinSNMP 1.1a specification and the WinSNMP 2.0 Addendum.
