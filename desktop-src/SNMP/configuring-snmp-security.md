# Configuring SNMP Security

SNMP's security features allow you to specify the communities and hosts from which a computer accepts requests, as well as the type of operations to accept from the computers belonging to a community. SNMP also allows you to specify whether to send an authentication trap when an unauthorized community or host requests information.

For more information, refer to the Windows Resource Kit and to the SNMP service online documentation.

**Windows Server 2003:** By default, community names are not configured, and the SNMP service is configured to accept SNMP requests only from the host name "localhost".
