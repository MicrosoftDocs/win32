The following list describes new and updated feature areas for Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2. For more information on new Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 technologies, see [Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 Technologies](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/whatsnew/windows-8-technologies).

## What's New for Windows Server 2012 R2

-   [Data Deduplication](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dedup/data-deduplication-api-portal)

    Data deduplication finds and removes duplication within data on a volume while ensuring that the data remains correct and complete. This makes it possible to store more file data in less space on the volume. For Windows Server 2012 R2, a number of parameters and error codes were activated, and the [**MSFT\_DedupFileMetadata**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dedup/msft-dedupfilemetadata) class was added.

-   [Software Inventory Logging](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/sil/software-inventory-logging-portal)

Applications and technology to support easy configuration must also enable IT professionals to manage the risk associated with having uncontrolled devices connected to the corporate network. The Mobile Device Management (MDM) registration enrolls a device into a management service.
