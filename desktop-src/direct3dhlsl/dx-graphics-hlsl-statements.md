# Statements

HLSL statements are combinations of variables and functions that make up expressions; like a sentence, an HLSL statement requires operators that determine how an expression will be evaluated. You may create individual statements in a shader, or create several statements in a group called a statement block. In order to create HLSL statements, you will need to know the syntax for writing expressions, and the operators that you will use to combine expressions.
