# imm\_atomic\_alloc (sm5 - asm)

Atomically increment the hidden 32-bit counter stored with a Count or Append unordered access view (UAV), returning the original value.

## Remarks

There is a hidden unsigned 32-bit integer counter value associated with each Count or Append Buffer view which is initialized when the view is bound to the pipeline, including the option to keep the previous value.

This instruction does an atomic increment of the counter value, returning the original to *dst0*.

For an Append UAV, the returned value is only valid for the duration of the shader invocation. after that the implementation may rearrange the memory layout. Any memory addressing based on the returned value must be limited to the shader invocation.

For an Append UAV, within the shader invocation the HLSL compiler can use the returned value as the struct index to use for accessing the structured buffer. Accessing any struct index other than those locations returned by call(s) to **imm\_atomic\_alloc** or [\_consume](imm-atomic-consume--sm5---asm-.md) produce undefined results in that exactly which memory location within the UAV is being accessed is random and only fixed for the lifetime of the shader invocation.

For a Count UAV, the returned value can be saved by the application as a reference to a fixed location within the UAV that is meaningful after the shader invocation is over. Any location in a Count UAV may always be accessed independent of what the count value is.

There is no clamping of the count, so it wraps on overflow.

The same shader cannot attempt both **imm\_atomic\_alloc** and **imm\_atomic\_consume** on the same UAV. Further, the GPU cannot allow multiple shader invocations to mix **imm\_atomic\_alloc** and **imm\_atomic\_consume** on the same UAV.

This instruction applies to the following shader stages:



| Vertex | Hull | Domain | Geometry | Pixel | Compute |
|--------|------|--------|----------|-------|---------|
|        |      |        |          | X     | X       |



 

Because UAVs are available at all shader stages for Direct3D 11.1, this instruction applies to all shader stages for the Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows 8.



| Vertex | Hull | Domain | Geometry | Pixel | Compute |
|--------|------|--------|----------|-------|---------|
| X      | X    | X      | X        | X     | X       |
