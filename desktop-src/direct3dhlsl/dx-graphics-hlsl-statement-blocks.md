# Statement Blocks

A statement block contains one or more statements; each statement is made up of [expressions](dx-graphics-hlsl-expressions.md) and [operators](dx-graphics-hlsl-operators.md).


```
{
   statement 1;
   statement 2;
   ...
   statement n;
}
```



A statement block also indicates subscope. Variables declared within a statement block are only recognized within the block.
