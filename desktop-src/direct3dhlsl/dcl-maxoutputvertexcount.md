# dcl\_maxOutputVertexCount (sm4 - asm)

Declares the maximum number of vertices that can be output by a geometry shader.



| dcl\_maxOutputVertexCount *count* |
|-----------------------------------|



 



| Item                                                               | Description                                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span id="count"></span><span id="COUNT"></span>*count*<br/> | \[in\] A 32-bit unsigned integer between 1 and n, inclusive.<br/> |



 

A geometry shader can output a maximum of 1024 32-bit values. This maximum includes the size of the input data and the size of the data created by the shader.

Here are a few limitations:

-   If the number of vertices is reached before the geometry shader finishes executing, the shader terminates.
-   A geometry-shader can reach the end of its program before outputting any vertices; this is perfectly legal.
-   If you are debugging a geometry shader, you can tell the number of vertices generated by counting the number of emit instructions generated.

This instruction applies to the following shader stages:



| Vertex Shader | Geometry Shader | Pixel Shader |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
|               | x               |              |



 

This instruction is included to aid in debugging a shader in assembly; you cannot author a shader in assembly language using Shader Model 4.

## Example

Here are some examples.

Assume input data made up of position (.xyzw) and color (.rgb). Each component consumes one byte; given 7 bytes, the maximum number of vertices the shader can generate would be 1024 / (4 + 3) = 146.


```
dcl_maxOutputVertexCount 146
```



Assume your geometry shader creates 32 4-component vectors. The maximum number of vertices the shader can generate would be 1024 / (32 \* 4) = 8.


```
dcl_maxOutputVertexCount 8
```



## Minimum Shader Model

This function is supported in the following shader models.



| Shader Model                                              | Supported |
