# Packing rules for constant variables

Packing rules dictate how tightly data can be arranged when it is stored. HLSL implements packing rules for VS output data, GS input and output data, and PS input and output data. (Data is not packed for VS inputs because the IA stage cannot unpack data.)

HLSL packing rules are similar to performing a **\#pragma pack 4** with Visual Studio, which packs data into 4-byte boundaries. Additionally, HLSL packs data so that it does not cross a 16-byte boundary. Variables are packed into a given four-component vector until the variable will straddle a 4-vector boundary; the next variables will be bounced to the next four-component vector.

Each structure forces the next variable to start on the next four-component vector. This sometimes generates padding for arrays of structures. The resulting size of any structure will always be evenly divisible by **sizeof**(*four-component vector*).

Arrays are not packed in HLSL by default. To avoid forcing the shader to take on ALU overhead for offset computations, every element in an array is stored in a four-component vector. Note that you can achieve packing for arrays (and incur the addressing calculations) by using casting.

Following are examples of structures and their corresponding packed sizes (given: a **float1** occupies 4 bytes):

```
//  2 x 16byte elements
cbuffer IE
{
    float4 Val1;
    float2 Val2;  // starts a new vector
    float2 Val3;
};

//  3 x 16byte elements
cbuffer IE
{
    float2 Val1;
    float4 Val2;  // starts a new vector
    float2 Val3;  // starts a new vector
};

//  1 x 16byte elements
cbuffer IE
{
    float1 Val1;
    float1 Val2;
    float2 Val3;
};

//  1 x 16byte elements
cbuffer IE
{
    float1 Val1;
    float2 Val2;
    float1 Val3;
};

//  2 x 16byte elements
cbuffer IE
{
    float1 Val1;
    float1 Val1;
    float1 Val1;
    float2 Val2;    // starts a new vector
};


//  1 x 16byte elements
cbuffer IE
{
    float3 Val1;
    float1 Val2;
};

//  1 x 16byte elements
cbuffer IE
{
    float1 Val1;
    float3 Val2;
};

//  2 x 16byte elements
cbuffer IE
{
    float1 Val1;
    float1 Val1;
    float3 Val2;        // starts a new vector
};


// 3 x 16byte elements
cbuffer IE
{
    float1 Val1;

    struct     {
        float4 SVal1;    // starts a new vector
        float1 SVal2;    // starts a new vector
    } Val2;
};

// 3 x 16byte elements
cbuffer IE
{
    float1 Val1;  
    struct     {
        float1 SVal1;     // starts a new vector
        float4 SVal2;     // starts a new vector
    } Val2;
};

// 3 x 16byte elements
cbuffer IE
{
    struct     {
        float4 SVal1;
        float1 SVal2;    // starts a new vector
    } Val1;

    float1 Val2; 
};
```

## More aggressive packing

You can pack an array more aggressively; here's an example. Say that you want to access an array like this from the constant buffer:

```
// Original array: not efficiently packed.
float2 myArray[32];
```

In the constant buffer, the declaration above will consume 32 4-element vectors. That's because each array element will be placed at the beginning of one of these vectors. Now, if you want these values packed tightly (without any spaces) in the constant buffer, and you still want to access the array in the shader as a `float2[32]` array, then you could write this instead:

```
float4 packedArrayInCBuffer[16];
// shader uses myArray here:
static const float2 myArray[32] = (float2[32])packedArrayInCBuffer;
```

The tighter packing is a tradeoff versus the need for additional shader instructions for address computation.
