# Side-by-Side Assembly Structures

The side-by-side assembly API uses the following structures.



| Structure                                                       | Description                                                                            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**ASSEMBLY\_INFO**](/windows/desktop/api/Winsxs/ns-winsxs-assembly_info)                        | Contains information about an assembly in the system's side-by-side assembly store.    |
| [**FUSION\_INSTALL\_REFERENCE**](/windows/win32/api/winsxs/ns-winsxs-fusion_install_reference) | Contains information about the application which references the side-by-side assembly. |
