# Installing Side-by-side Assemblies

You may install side-by-side assemblies as [shared assemblies](/windows/desktop/Msi/shared-assemblies) or as [private assemblies](/windows/desktop/Msi/private-assemblies). For more information, see [Installing Side-by-Side Assemblies as Private Assemblies](installing-side-by-side-assemblies-as-private-assemblies.md) and [Installing Side-by-side Assemblies as Shared Assemblies](installing-side-by-side-assemblies-as-shared-assemblies.md).

Note that:

-   Assemblies installed to the global assembly cache by an installation using the per-user [installation context](/windows/desktop/Msi/installation-context) are not protected by Windows File Protection.
-   Assemblies that are installed to the global assembly cache by an installation using the per-machine [installation context](/windows/desktop/Msi/installation-context) are protected by Windows File Protection.
