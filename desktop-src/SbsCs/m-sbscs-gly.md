</dt> <dd>

XML file that describes a side-by-side assembly or an isolated application. A manifest file may contain binding and activation metadata traditionally stored in the registry, such as COM classes, interfaces, and type libraries. Every isolated application or side-by-side assembly is accompanied by a manifest file. An application manifest describes a fully or partially isolated application and an assembly manifest describes a side-by-side assembly.

</dt> <dd>

Information stored in a manifest file about the binding or activation of an isolated application or side-by-side assembly. For example, information about COM classes, interfaces and type libraries, traditionally stored in the registry may be stored as metadata in a manifest. Metadata describes the items that make up an assembly and its dependencies on other side-by-side assemblies. The metadata specified in the application manifest and dependent assemblies may be used to populate the activation context.
