A shared side-by-side assembly is available for use by multiple applications on the computer. It is installed in the Winsxs folder of the Windows directory. Applications and administrators can manage the version of a shared assembly to be used by specifying the application configuration. Side-by-side assemblies are always accompanied by manifest files that provide information about the assembly to the operating system.

A side-by-side assembly is a Win32 assembly accompanied by manifests. A side-by-side assembly contains a collection of resources—a group of DLLs, windows classes, COM servers, type libraries, or interfaces—that are always provided to applications together.

</dt> <dd>

Use of side-by-side assemblies to safely share assemblies among multiple applications and to offset the negative effects of sharing, such as DLL conflicts. Instead of having a single version of an assembly that assumes backward compatibility with all applications, side-by-side assembly sharing enables multiple versions of a Win32 assembly to run simultaneously on the system. Side-by-side assemblies are always accompanied by assembly manifest files that provide information about the assembly to the operating system. Applications and administrators can manage side-by-side assembly sharing after deployment by updating the application configuration on either a global or per-application basis.
