Application using side-by-side assemblies, but not sharing its assemblies. An isolated application is always accompanied by an application manifest file. The manifest specifies the versions of the shared side-by-side assemblies that the application binds to at run time and may contain some metadata for private side-by-side assemblies. The manifest contains information traditionally stored in the registry; a fully isolated application may be independent of the registry.
