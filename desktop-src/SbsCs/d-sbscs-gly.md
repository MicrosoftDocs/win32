An **assemblyIdentity** subelement defining the side-by-side assembly described by the manifest. A DEF-context **assemblyIdentity** subelement is always the first subelement of an **assembly** element.

Compatibility problem. Assembly sharing problems occur when an application installs a version of a shared assembly that is not backward compatible with the previously installed version. A solution to DLL versioning conflicts is to use side-by-side assembly sharing and isolated applications. With side-by-side assembly sharing, multiple versions of the same Windows assembly can run simultaneously. Developers can choose which side-by-side assembly to use.
