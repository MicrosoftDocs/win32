# Side-by-Side Assembly API

The Side-by-Side Assembly API installs, removes, or queries side-by-side assemblies from the system's side-by-side assembly store. This is also called the winSxS store on Windows XP and the Component Servicing Infrastructure (CSI) component store starting with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.

The parts of the Side-by-Side Assembly API are described in the following sections:

-   [Side-by-Side Assembly Enumerations](enumerations.md)
-   [Side-by-Side Assembly Functions](side-by-side-assembly-functions.md)
-   [Side-by-Side Assembly Interfaces](side-by-side-assembly-interfaces.md)
-   [Side-by-Side Assembly Structures](structures.md)
