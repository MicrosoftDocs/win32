# Windows Imaging Component

## Purpose

The Windows Imaging Component (WIC) is an extensible platform that provides low-level API for digital images.  WIC supports the standard web image formats, high dynamic range images, and raw camera data.  WIC also supports additional features such as:

-   Built-in support for standard metadata formats
-   Extensible framework for image codecs, pixel formats, and metadata formats.
-   Wide range of pixel format support.
-   High-color support; including 30-bit extended range, 30-bit high precision, and 48-bit high precision and wide gamut pixel formats.
-   Progressive image decoding.

## Developer Audience

WIC is designed to meet the needs of the following classes of developers:

-   Developers who read and write image data in an application.
-   Developers who read and write image metadata in an application.
-   Developers who want run-time codec discovery for newly designed or implemented image codecs.
-   Developers designing or implementing new image codecs and metadata formats.
