# WIC Samples

This section contains the Windows Imaging Component (WIC) samples.

WIC provides two types of examples:

-   Samples: Code segments that use several WIC features. Source code for the sample is delivered in the Windows SDK.
-   Code Examples: Shorter samples that demonstrate a specific feature. Source code for the sample is not provided with the SDK.
