# Compression API

## Purpose

The Compression API exposes the Windows MSZIP, XPRESS, XPRESS\_HUFF, and LZMS compression algorithms. This enables developers of Windows applications to manage versions, service, and extend the exposed compression algorithms.

## Developer audience

The Compression API is designed for use by professional C/C++ developers of Windows applications. The Compression API exposes the lossless compression algorithms used by Windows though a public interface and user-mode API. The Compression API is the recommended method for Windows developers to control the compression algorithms. This feature is 64-bit on 64-bit Windows and 32-bit on 32-bit Windows.

## Run-time requirements

The Compression API is available beginning with the Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012.
