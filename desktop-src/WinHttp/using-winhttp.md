# Using WinHTTP

This section describes how to use both the C/C++ API for Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP) and the COM interface exposed by the **WinHttpRequest** Object. See [Choosing a WinHTTP Interface](choosing-a-winhttp-interface.md) for a comparison of these interfaces. It also describes how to use the administrative tools included with WinHTTP.
