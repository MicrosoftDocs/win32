# WinHTTP Interfaces

[Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP)](about-winhttp.md) exposes the following two interfaces:

-   [**IWinHttpRequest**](iwinhttprequest-interface.md) implements WinHTTP methods that do not involve events.
-   [**IWinHttpRequestEvents**](iwinhttprequestevents-interface.md) implements WinHTTP events and event-based methods.
