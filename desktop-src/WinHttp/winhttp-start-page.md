# Windows HTTP Services

## Purpose

Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP) provides developers with an HTTP client application programming interface (API) to send requests through the HTTP protocol to other HTTP servers.

## Where applicable

WinHTTP supports desktop client applications, Windows services, and Windows server-based applications.

For more information on how to use WinHTTP for applications built on the Microsoft .NET Framework, see the [WinHttpHandler API](/dotnet/api/system.net.http)

## Developer audience

WinHTTP offers both a C/C++ application programming interface (API) and a Component Object Model (COM) automation component suitable for use in Active Server Pages (ASP) based applications.

A basic understanding of the HTTP protocol is important to use either interface.

## Run-time requirements

WinHTTP 5.1 offers improvements over version 5.0. It is included in the operating system. For more information about new features, see [What's New in WinHTTP 5.1](what-s-new-in-winhttp-5-1.md) and [What's New in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista](what-s-new-in-windows-longhorn.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The WinHTTP 5.0 download is no longer available. As of October 1, 2004, Microsoft removed the WinHTTP 5.0 SDK download from MSDN and terminated product support for version 5.0.
