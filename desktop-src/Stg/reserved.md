# Reserved

The value of the **DWORD** data type is reserved for future use. Writers of property sets should set this value to 1; readers of property sets should ensure that this value is at least 1. An exception to this guideline is that, for [The DocumentSummaryInformation and UserDefined Property Sets](the-documentsummaryinformation-and-userdefined-property-sets.md), this value may be 2.
