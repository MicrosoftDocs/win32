# IPropertySetStorage Implementation Considerations

Several issues arise when considering how to provide an implementation of the [**IPropertySetStorage**](/windows/desktop/api/Propidl/nn-propidl-ipropertysetstorage) interface that reads and writes the COM property set format. The following sections describe these considerations.

-   [Names in IStorage](names-in-istorage.md)
-   [Storage and Stream Objects for a Property Set](storage-vs--stream-for-a-property-set.md)
-   [Setting the Property Set Class Identifier](setting-the-property-set-class-identifier.md)
-   [Synchronization Points](synchronization-points.md)
-   [Code Pages and Unicode Strings](code-pages-and-unicode-strings.md)
-   [Dictionary](dictionary.md)
-   [Extensions](extensions.md)
-   [Property Set Serialization](version-0-vs--version-1-property-set-serialization.md)

For more information, see [**IPropertySetStorage**](/windows/desktop/api/Propidl/nn-propidl-ipropertysetstorage) in the Reference section under Interfaces.
