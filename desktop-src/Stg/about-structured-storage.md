# About Structured Storage

Traditional file systems encounter challenges when they attempt to store efficiently multiple kinds of objects in one document. COM provides a solution: a file system within a file. COM structured storage defines how to treat a single file entity as a structured collection of two types of objects—storages and streams—that perform like directories and files. This scheme is called *structured storage*. The purpose of structured storage is to reduce the performance penalties and overhead associated with storing separate objects in a flat file.

This section contains an overview of structured storage benefits and fundamentals, property sets and asynchronous structured storage as well as a historical look at file systems:

-   Compound file implementation
-   NTFS file system implementation
-   Stand-alone implementation

This section includes links to [The Evolution of File Systems](the-evolution-of-file-systems.md), [Storages and Streams](storages-and-streams.md), [Compound Files](compound-files.md), [Structured Storage Fundamentals](structured-storage-fundamentals.md), and [Structured Storage Samples](using-structured-storage.md).
