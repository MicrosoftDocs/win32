# Extensible Authentication Protocol

## Purpose

The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a standard supported by several system components. EAP is crucial for protecting the security of wireless (802.1X) and wired LANs, Dial-up, and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

## Where applicable

EAP improves on previous authentication protocols such as Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP).

For new EAP method development, see [Extensible Authentication Protocol Host](../eaphost/portal.md).

## Developer audience

The EAP API is designed for use by C/C++ programmers. Programmers should be familiar with networking concepts.

## Run-time requirements

EAP is supported on client and server computers running on  Windows 2000 and later. EAP is also supported on computers running on Windows 2000 Server and later if they are running Internet Authentication Service (IAS). For more information about supported operating systems, see the Requirements section in the documentation.
