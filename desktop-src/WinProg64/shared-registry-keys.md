# Registry Keys Affected by WOW64

Under WOW64, certain registry keys are *redirected*. When a 32-bit or 64-bit application makes a registry call for a redirected key, the registry redirector intercepts the call and maps it to the key's corresponding physical registry location. For more information, see [Registry Redirector](registry-redirector.md).

Other registry keys are *shared* by both 32-bit and 64-bit applications on 64-bit Windows. 32-bit registry calls to shared keys are not redirected. Instead, one physical copy of the key is mapped into each logical view of the registry.

**Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP:** A subset of redirected registry keys are also reflected to keep the keys and their values synchronized between 32-bit and 64-bit views of the registry. Registry reflection was removed starting with Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see [Registry Reflection](registry-reflection.md).

This topic lists registry keys that are redirected, shared, or redirected and reflected under WOW64. It also lists symbolic links that provide compatibility for existing applications that may use hardcoded registry key paths containing **Wow6432Node**. For more information, see the following:

-   [Redirected, Shared, and Reflected Keys Under WOW64](#redirected-shared-and-reflected-keys-under-wow64)

## Redirected, Shared, and Reflected Keys Under WOW64

The following table lists registry keys that are redirected, shared by both 32-bit and 64-bit applications, or redirected and reflected on 64-bit Windows. Subkeys of the keys in this table inherit the parent key's behavior unless otherwise specified. If a key has no parent listed in this table, the key is shared.

**HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER** is a symbolic link to **HKEY\_USERS\\\*** where \* indicates a match for all user security IDs (SIDs). **HKEY\_USERS\\\*\\SOFTWARE\\Classes** is a symbolic link to **HKEY\_USERS\\\*\_Classes**.

**HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT** is a merged view of **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes** and **HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Classes**. Redirected keys in these registry paths are effectively redirected for **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT** also. This is also true for reflected keys on systems that support them.

## WOW64 Symbolic Links

WOW64 defines the following symbolic links only for compatibility with existing applications that may use hardcoded registry key paths containing Wow6432Node. New applications should avoid using Wow6432Node in registry key paths.

-   **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Classes** is linked to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\Wow6432Node**
-   **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\Wow6432Node\\AppId** is linked to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\AppId**
-   **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\Wow6432Node\\PROTOCOLS** is linked to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\PROTOCOLS**
-   **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\Wow6432Node\\Typelib** is linked to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\Typelib**

**Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP:  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Classes** is linked to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\Wow6432Node**. Other symbolic links were added in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.
