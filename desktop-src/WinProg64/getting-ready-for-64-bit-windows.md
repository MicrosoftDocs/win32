# Getting Ready for 64-bit Windows

A key goal of the 64-bit version of Windows is to make it easy for developers to use a single source-code base for their 32-bit and 64-bit applications. This overview describes how to make your source code support both 32-bit and 64-bit computing. Familiarity with existing [Windows data types](/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types) will help.
