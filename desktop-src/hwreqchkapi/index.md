# HWREQCHK API

## Purpose

The Hardware Requirement Evaluator (HWREQCHK) library is a set of APIs that allows callers to get information about a hardware device and determine if the machine is eligible to run a specific version of Windows 11 (and new versions of the OS as they become available). The API queries various hardware properties and evaluates rules to determine eligibility.

## Developer audience

The HWREQCHK API is designed for use by professional C/C++ developers of Windows applications. Developers can use the API to get information about a hardware device and determine if the machine is eligible to run a specific version of Windows.

## Run-time requirements

The HWREQCHK API is available beginning with Windows 10, version xxxx and Windows 11, version xxxx.
