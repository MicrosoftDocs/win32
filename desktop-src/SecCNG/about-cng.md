# About CNG

Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG) is the long-term replacement for the [*CryptoAPI*](/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly). CNG is designed to be extensible at many levels and cryptography agnostic in behavior.

## Features

For information about the features of CNG, see [CNG Features](cng-features.md).

## Cryptographic Primitives

For more information about the cryptographic primitives in CNG, see [Cryptographic Primitives](cryptographic-primitives.md).

## Key Storage and Retrieval

For more information about key storage and retrieval in CNG, see [Key Storage and Retrieval](key-storage-and-retrieval.md).

## Key Import and Export

For more information about importing and exporting keys, see [Key Import and Export](key-import-and-export.md).

## Data Protection API: Next Generation

CNG provides a set of APIs that can be used to easily encrypt and decrypt content to authorization principals across multiple computers. For more information, see [CNG DPAPI](cng-dpapi.md).
