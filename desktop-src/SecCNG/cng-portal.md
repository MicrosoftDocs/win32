# Cryptography API: Next Generation

## Purpose

Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG) is the long-term replacement for the [*CryptoAPI*](../secgloss/c-gly.md). CNG is designed to be extensible at many levels and cryptography agnostic in behavior.

## Developer audience

CNG is intended for use by developers of applications that will enable users to create and exchange documents and other data in a secure environment, especially over nonsecure media such as the Internet. Developers should be familiar with the C and C++ programming languages and the Windows-based programming environment. Although not required, an understanding of cryptography or security-related subjects is advised.

If you are developing a CNG cryptographic algorithm provider or key storage provider, you must download the [Cryptographic Provider Development Kit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30688) from Microsoft.

## Run-time requirements

CNG is supported beginning with Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista. For information about run-time requirements for a particular programming element, see the Requirements section of the reference page for that element.
