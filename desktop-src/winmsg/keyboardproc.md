# KeyboardProc callback function

## Description

An application-defined or library-defined callback function used with the [**SetWindowsHookExA**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowshookexa)/[**SetWindowsHookExW**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowshookexw) function.

The system calls this function whenever an application calls the [**GetMessage**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getmessage) or [**PeekMessageA**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-peekmessagea)/[**PeekMessageW**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-peekmessagew) function and there is a keyboard message ([**WM_KEYUP**](/windows/win32/inputdev/wm-keyup) or [**WM_KEYDOWN**](/windows/win32/inputdev/wm-keydown) to be processed.

The **HOOKPROC** type defines a pointer to this callback function. *KeyboardProc* is a placeholder for the application-defined or library-defined function name.

```cpp
LRESULT CALLBACK KeyboardProc(
  _In_ int    code,
  _In_ WPARAM wParam,
  _In_ LPARAM lParam
);
```

## Parameters

### code [in]

Type: **int**

A code the hook procedure uses to determine how to process the message.

If *code* is less than zero, the hook procedure must pass the message to the [CallNextHookEx](/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-callnexthookex) function without further processing and should return the value returned by **CallNextHookEx**.

This parameter can be one of the following values.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **HC_ACTION** 0 | The *wParam* and *lParam* parameters contain information about a keystroke message. |
| **HC_NOREMOVE** 3 | The *wParam* and *lParam* parameters contain information about a keystroke message, and the keystroke message has not been removed from the message queue. (An application called the **PeekMessage** function, specifying the **PM_NOREMOVE** flag.) |

### wParam [in]

Type: **WPARAM**

The [virtual-key code](/windows/desktop/inputdev/virtual-key-codes) of the key that generated the keystroke message.

### lParam [in]

Type: **LPARAM**

The repeat count, scan code, extended-key flag, context code, previous key-state flag, and transition-state flag.
For more information about The *lParam* parameter, see [Keystroke Message Flags](/windows/desktop/inputdev/about-keyboard-input).
The following table describes the bits of this value.

| Bits | Description |
|-------|---------|
| 0-15 | The repeat count. The value is the number of times the keystroke is repeated as a result of the user's holding down the key. |
| 16-23 | The scan code. The value depends on the OEM. |
| 24 | Indicates whether the key is an extended key, such as a function key or a key on the numeric keypad. The value is 1 if the key is an extended key; otherwise, it is 0. |
| 25-28 | Reserved. |
| 29 | The context code. The value is 1 if the ALT key is down; otherwise, it is 0. |
| 30 | The previous key state. The value is 1 if the key is down before the message is sent; it is 0 if the key is up. |
| 31 | The transition state. The value is 0 if the key is being pressed and 1 if it is being released. |

## Returns

Type: **LRESULT**

If *code* is less than zero, the hook procedure must return the value returned by [**CallNextHookEx**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-callnexthookex).

If *code* is greater than or equal to zero, and the hook procedure did not process the message, it is highly recommended that you call [**CallNextHookEx**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-callnexthookex) and return the value it returns; otherwise, other applications that have installed [**WH_KEYBOARD**](/windows/win32/winmsg/about-hooks) hooks will not receive hook notifications and may behave incorrectly as a result. 

If the hook procedure processed the message, it may return a nonzero value to prevent the system from passing the message to the rest of the hook chain or the target window procedure.

## Remarks

An application installs the hook procedure by specifying the [**WH_KEYBOARD**](/windows/win32/winmsg/about-hooks) hook type and a pointer to the hook procedure in a call to the [**SetWindowsHookExA**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowshookexa)/[**SetWindowsHookExW**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowshookexw) function.

This hook may be called in the context of the thread that installed it. The call is made by sending a message to the thread that installed the hook. Therefore, the thread that installed the hook must have a message loop.
