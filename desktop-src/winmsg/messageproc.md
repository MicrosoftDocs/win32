# MessageProc function

## Description

An application-defined or library-defined callback function used with the [SetWindowsHookEx](/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowshookexw) function.
The system calls this function after an input event occurs in a dialog box, message box, menu, or scroll bar, but before the message generated by the input event is processed.
The hook procedure can monitor messages for a dialog box, message box, menu, or scroll bar created by a particular application or all applications.

The **HOOKPROC** type defines a pointer to this callback function.
**MessageProc** is a placeholder for the application-defined or library-defined function name.

```cpp
LRESULT CALLBACK MessageProc(
  _In_ int    code,
       WPARAM wParam,
  _In_ LPARAM lParam
);
```

## Parameters

### code [in]

Type: **int**

The type of input event that generated the message.
If *code* is less than zero, the hook procedure must pass the message to the [CallNextHookEx](/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-callnexthookex) function without further processing and return the value returned by **CallNextHookEx**.
This parameter can be one of the following values.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **MSGF_DDEMGR** 0x8001 | The input event occurred while the Dynamic Data Exchange Management Library (DDEML) was waiting for a synchronous transaction to finish. For more information about DDEML, see [Dynamic Data Exchange Management Library](../dataxchg/dynamic-data-exchange-management-library.md). |
| **MSGF_DIALOGBOX** 0 | The input event occurred in a message box or dialog box. |
| **MSGF_MENU** 2 | The input event occurred in a menu. |
| **MSGF_SCROLLBAR** 5 | The input event occurred in a scroll bar. |

### wParam

Type: **WPARAM**

This parameter is not used.

### lParam [in]

Type: **LPARAM**

A pointer to an [MSG](/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-msg) structure.

## Returns

Type: **LRESULT**

If *code* is less than zero, the hook procedure must return the value returned by **CallNextHookEx**.

If *code* is greater than or equal to zero, and the hook procedure did not process the message, it is highly recommended that you call **CallNextHookEx** and return the value it returns; otherwise, other applications that have installed [WH_MSGFILTER](about-hooks.md) hooks will not receive hook notifications and may behave incorrectly as a result.
If the hook procedure processed the message, it may return a nonzero value to prevent the system from passing the message to the rest of the hook chain or the target window procedure.

## Remarks

An application installs the hook procedure by specifying the **WH_MSGFILTER** hook type and a pointer to the hook procedure in a call to the **SetWindowsHookEx** function.

If an application that uses the DDEML and performs synchronous transactions must process messages before they are dispatched, it must use the **WH_MSGFILTER** hook.
