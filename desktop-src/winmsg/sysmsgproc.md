# SysMsgProc function

## Description

An application-defined or library-defined callback function used with the [SetWindowsHookEx](/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowshookexw) function.
The system calls this function after an input event occurs in a dialog box, message box, menu, or scroll bar, but before the message generated by the input event is processed.
The function can monitor messages for any dialog box, message box, menu, or scroll bar in the system.

The **HOOKPROC** type defines a pointer to this callback function.
**SysMsgProc** is a placeholder for the application-defined or library-defined function name.

```cpp
LRESULT CALLBACK SysMsgProc(
  _In_ int    nCode,
       WPARAM wParam,
  _In_ LPARAM lParam
);
```

## Parameters

### nCode [in]

Type: **int**

The type of input event that generated the message.
If *nCode* is less than zero, the hook procedure must pass the message to the [CallNextHookEx](/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-callnexthookex) function without further processing and should return the value returned by **CallNextHookEx**.
This parameter can be one of the following values.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **MSGF_DIALOGBOX** 0 | The input event occurred in a message box or dialog box. |
| **MSGF_MENU** 2 | The input event occurred in a menu. |
| **MSGF_SCROLLBAR** 5 | The input event occurred in a scroll bar. |

### wParam

Type: **WPARAM**

This parameter is not used.

### lParam [in]

Type: **LPARAM**

A pointer to an [MSG](/windows/desktop/api/winuser/ns-winuser-msg) message structure.

## Returns

Type: **LRESULT**

If *nCode* is less than zero, the hook procedure must return the value returned by **CallNextHookEx**.

If *nCode* is greater than or equal to zero, and the hook procedure did not process the message, it is highly recommended that you call **CallNextHookEx** and return the value it returns; otherwise, other applications that have installed [WH_SYSMSGFILTER](about-hooks.md) hooks will not receive hook notifications and may behave incorrectly as a result.
If the hook procedure processed the message, it may return a nonzero value to prevent the system from passing the message to the target window procedure.

## Remarks

An application installs the hook procedure by specifying the **WH_SYSMSGFILTER** hook type and a pointer to the hook procedure in a call to the **SetWindowsHookEx** function.
