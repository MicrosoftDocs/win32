# MouseProc function

## Description

An application-defined or library-defined callback function used with the [SetWindowsHookEx](/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowshookexw) function.
The system calls this function whenever an application calls the [GetMessage](/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getmessage) or [PeekMessage](/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-peekmessagew) function and there is a mouse message to be processed.

The **HOOKPROC** type defines a pointer to this callback function.
**MouseProc** is a placeholder for the application-defined or library-defined function name.

```cpp
LRESULT CALLBACK MouseProc(
  _In_ int    nCode,
  _In_ WPARAM wParam,
  _In_ LPARAM lParam
);
```

## Parameters

### nCode [in]

Type: **int**

A code that the hook procedure uses to determine how to process the message.
If *nCode* is less than zero, the hook procedure must pass the message to the [CallNextHookEx](/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-callnexthookex) function without further processing and should return the value returned by **CallNextHookEx**.
This parameter can be one of the following values.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **HC_ACTION** 0 | The *wParam* and *lParam* parameters contain information about a mouse message. |
| **HC_NOREMOVE** 3 | The *wParam* and *lParam* parameters contain information about a mouse message, and the mouse message has not been removed from the message queue. (An application called the **PeekMessage** function, specifying the **PM_NOREMOVE** flag.) |

### wParam [in]

Type: **WPARAM**

The identifier of the mouse message.

### lParam [in]

Type: **LPARAM**

A pointer to a [MOUSEHOOKSTRUCT](/windows/desktop/api/winuser/ns-winuser-mousehookstruct) structure.

## Returns

Type: **LRESULT**

If *nCode* is less than zero, the hook procedure must return the value returned by **CallNextHookEx**.

If *nCode* is greater than or equal to zero, and the hook procedure did not process the message, it is highly recommended that you call **CallNextHookEx** and return the value it returns; otherwise, other applications that have installed [WH_MOUSE](about-hooks.md) hooks will not receive hook notifications and may behave incorrectly as a result.
If the hook procedure processed the message, it may return a nonzero value to prevent the system from passing the message to the target window procedure.

## Remarks

An application installs the hook procedure by specifying the WH_MOUSE hook type and a pointer to the hook procedure in a call to the **SetWindowsHookEx** function.

The hook procedure must not install a [WH_JOURNALPLAYBACK](about-hooks.md) callback function.

This hook may be called in the context of the thread that installed it.
The call is made by sending a message to the thread that installed the hook.
Therefore, the thread that installed the hook must have a message loop.
