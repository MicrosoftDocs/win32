| [Performance Counters](./perfctrs/performance-counters-portal.md)<br/>                                     | Counters are used to provide information as to how well the operating system or an application, service, or driver is performing. The counter data can help determine system bottlenecks and fine-tune system and application performance. The operating system, network, and devices provide counter data that an application can consume to provide users with a graphical view of how well the system is performing.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                |

Programmers can also use PLA to query performance data, create event tracing sessions, capture a computer's configuration, and trace the API calls in some of the Win32 system DLLs.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [Process Snapshotting](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/proc_snap/process-snapshotting-portal)<br/>                                | Process snapshotting enables you to capture process state, in part or whole. It is similar to the [Tool Help](./toolhelp/tool-help-library.md) API, but with one important advantage: it can efficiently capture the virtual address contents of a process using the Windows internal POSIX fork clone capability. The process snapshot can be dumped into a file using the [**MiniDumpWriteDump**](/windows/win32/api/minidumpapiset/nf-minidumpapiset-minidumpwritedump) function.<br/>                                                                                                                                                       |

| [System Event Notification Service](./sens/system-event-notification-service-portal.md)<br/>           | Applications designed for use by mobile users require a unique set of connectivity functions and notifications. In the past these individual applications were required to implement these features internally. The System Event Notification Service (SENS) now provides these capabilities in the operating system, creating a uniform connectivity and notification interface for applications. Using SENS developers can determine connection bandwidth and latency information from within their application and optimize the application's operation based on those conditions. <br/> |
