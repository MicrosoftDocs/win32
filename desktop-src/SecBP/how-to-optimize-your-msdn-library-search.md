# How to Optimize Your MSDN Library Search

To search MSDN, enter a keyword or character string in the **Search MSDN with Bing** box. After you search the [Microsoft Developer Network](https://msdn.microsoft.com/default.aspx) (MSDN) website, you can narrow your search results by clicking the options available in the **Refine search** column under **By Source** or **By Topic**. These options become available after your first search attempt.

**To return only topics in the Windows Development section of MSDN Library**

1.  In the **By Topic** list, click **Win32 & COM**. An additional list called **Current Refinements** appears. The **Current Refinements** line has **Win32 & COM** in it.
2.  In the **By Source** list, click **Documentation & Articles**. The **Current Refinements** list now includes **Documentation & Articles**.

As you search, additional filters may become available, for example, **Windows Security**, **Windows Graphics and Multimedia**, or **Windows Messaging and Collaboration**.

**To search only topics in the Security SDK**

-   In the **By Topic** list, click **Windows Security**. The **Current Refinements** list now includes **Windows Security**.

When you type a search string, suggestions automatically appear below the search box. To search for SDK content, look for **api** or **windows** in the suggestions.

When you click a topic in the search results, you can quickly determine whether the topic provides SDK content by viewing the navigation path that appears at the top of the topic. For example, a search for **cryptography** generates suggestions that include **cryptography api**. Clicking the suggestion **cryptography api**, generates a search results pane that includes **Cryptography Functions (Windows)**. Clicking **Cryptography Functions (Windows)**, brings you to a topic that contains the following navigation path across the top of the topic:

**MSDN > MSDN Library > Windows Development > Security > Cryptography > Cryptography Reference > Cryptography Functions >**

All Security SDK content contains this portion of that navigation path:

**MSDN > MSDN Library > Windows Development > Security >**

**To remove search results filters from your MSDN search**

-   In the **Current Refinements** list, click the **(x)** that follows the search filter you want to remove. For example, to remove **Documentation & Articles** from **Current Refinements**, click the **(x)** that follows **Documentation & Articles**. You can also click **Remove All** to remove all filters from your MSDN search.
