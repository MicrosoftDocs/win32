# Using Event Logging

Applications can use the Event Logging API to report and view events. For details on reporting events, see [Reporting Events](reporting-an-event.md).

To view events that have been written to log files, see [Querying for Event Source Messages](querying-for-event-source-messages.md) and [Receiving Event Notification](receiving-event-notification.md). You can also use the Event Viewer to view events.
