# Security app detection rules update

## Platforms

<dl> **Clients** – Windows 8  
**Servers** – Windows Server 2012  
</dl>

### Description

The Windows Store apps being added in Windows 8 are all being installed to a common location under “Program Files” (%programfiles%) called \\program files\\WindowsApps.

### Manifestation

This can cause collisions with existing configurations, and some antivirus/anti-malware detectors see this location as a potential location that is a cause for concern.

### Mitigation

The current recommendations are:

-   Move away from \\program files\\WindowsApps for storing any custom apps
-   Antivirus/antimalware vendors should update their heuristics so they do not identify that location as a malware location
