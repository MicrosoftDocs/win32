# Undocumented APIs

Your apps should not call undocumented Windows APIs, or take dependency on specific Windows file exports or registry keys. This can lead to broken functionality, data loss and potential security issues. If there is functionality your app requires that is not available, this is an opportunity to provide feedback through your usual feedback channels and via the Windows Insider program.
