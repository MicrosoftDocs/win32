# Windows Hardware Certification Kit

## Platforms

 **Clients** - Windows 7 \| Windows 8  
**Servers** - Windows Server 2008 R2 \| Windows Server 2012  
**Server/Controller** - Windows Server 2008 R2  


## Description

The Windows Hardware Certification Kit enables developers, ISVs, IHVs, and OEMs to certify their hardware devices, systems, and filter drivers for the latest Windows operating systems. It contains all the tools and documentation that you need to certify your hardware and filter drivers for these operating systems:

-   Windows 8
-   Windows Server 2012
-   Windows 7
-   Windows Server 2008 R2

The Windows Hardware Certification Kit replaces the Windows Logo Kit and is a part of the Windows Certification Program.

## Usage or best practices

Before you can test any hardware or filter driver, you must set up the proper test environment based on the hardware or filter driver you are certifying. This includes the controller, client, and potentially additional hardware (for example, multi-function devices) or software. After your environment is set up, you can test your hardware using the new HCK’s Studio tool. These steps outline the certification test process.

1.  Set up test environment.
2.  Create a project.
3.  Create one or more machine pools.
4.  Select features to validate.
5.  Select and run tests against those features.
6.  View test results.
7.  Submit your package.
