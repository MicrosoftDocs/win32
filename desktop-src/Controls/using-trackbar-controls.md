| [How to Create a Trackbar](create-a-trackbar.md)<br/>                                           | When the trackbar is created, both its range and its selection range are initialized. The page size is also set at this time. <br/>                                                                                                                                           |
| [How to Process Trackbar Notification Messages](process-trackbar-notification-messages.md)<br/> | Trackbars notify their parent window of user actions by sending the parent a [**WM\_HSCROLL**](wm-hscroll.md) or [**WM\_VSCROLL**](wm-vscroll.md) message. <br/>                                                                                                            |
| [How to Limit Slider Movement](limit-slider-movement.md)<br/>                                   | As described in [About Trackbar Controls](trackbar-controls.md), it is possible to set off part of the trackbar range as a selection range. One purpose of a selection range might be to limit movement of the slider, making some parts of the full range off limits. <br/> |
| [How to Use Buddy Windows](use-buddy-windows.md)<br/>                                           | By setting other controls as buddy windows for a trackbar, you can automatically position those controls at the ends of the trackbar as labels.<br/>                                                                                                                          |
