## Versions of Rich Edit

The original specification for rich edit controls is Microsoft Rich Edit 1.0; the current specification is Microsoft Rich Edit 4.1. Each version of rich edit is a superset of the preceding one, except that only Asian builds of Microsoft Rich Edit 1.0 have a vertical text option. Before creating a rich edit control, you should call the [**LoadLibrary**](/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya) function to verify which version of Microsoft Rich Edit is installed.

The following table shows which DLL corresponds with which version of Rich Edit. Note that the name of the file did not change from version 2.0 to version 3.0. This allows version 2.0 to be upgraded to version 3.0 without breaking existing code.



| Rich Edit version | DLL          | Window Class    |
|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1.0               | Riched32.dll | RICHEDIT\_CLASS |
| 2.0               | Riched20.dll | RICHEDIT\_CLASS |
| 3.0               | Riched20.dll | RICHEDIT\_CLASS |
| 4.1               | Msftedit.dll | MSFTEDIT\_CLASS |

With a few exceptions, Microsoft Rich Edit 2.0 uses the same functions, structures, and messages as Microsoft Rich Edit 1.0. Note, however, the following differences:

-   The name of the Microsoft Rich Edit 1.0 window class is **RichEdit**. Microsoft Rich Edit 2.0 has both ANSI and Unicode window classes **RichEdit20A** and **RichEdit20W,** respectively. To specify the appropriate rich edit window class, use the RICHEDIT\_CLASS constant, which the Richedit.h file defines depending on the definition of the UNICODE compile flag.
-   In Microsoft Rich Edit 2.0, if you create a Unicode rich edit control (one that expects Unicode text messages), you must specify only Unicode data in any window messages sent to the control. Similarly, if you create an ANSI rich edit control, send only ANSI or double-byte character set (DBCS) data. You can use the [**IsWindowUnicode**](/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-iswindowunicode) function to determine whether a rich edit control uses Unicode text messages. Note that the rich edit COM interfaces use Unicode text unless they encounter a code page argument.
-   Microsoft Rich Edit 1.0 used CR/LF character combinations for paragraph markers. Microsoft Rich Edit 2.0 used only a carriage return character ('\\r'). Microsoft Rich Edit 3.0 uses only a carriage return character but can emulate Microsoft Rich Edit 1.0 in this regard.
-   Microsoft Rich Edit 2.0 introduced the following new messages. 

    | Message                                           | Description                                                             |

### Rich Edit Version 3.0

Microsoft Rich Edit 3.0 is a single, scalable, world-wide DLL that offers high performance and compatibility with Word in a small package. New features for Microsoft Rich Edit 3.0 include richer text, zoom, font binding, more powerful IME support, and rich complex script support (bidirectional, Indic, and Thai).

Microsoft Rich Edit 3.0 includes the following features in addition to the features provided by [Rich Edit Version 2.0](#rich-edit-version-20).

|    Feature                                           |    Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Zoom | The zoom factor is given by a ratio.|
| Paragraph numbering (single-level) | Numeric, upper and lower alphabetic, or Roman numeral.|
| Simple tables | Deleting and inserting rows is possible, but not resizing nor wrapping inside cells. With advanced typography turned on (see <a href="em-gettypographyoptions.md"><strong>EM_GETTYPOGRAPHYOPTIONS</strong></a>), Microsoft Rich Edit 3.0 can align columns centered or flush right, and include decimals. Cells are simulated by tabs, so text tabs and carriage returns are replaced by blanks. |
| Normal and heading styles | Built-in normal style and heading styles 1 through 9 are supported by the <a href="em-setparaformat.md"><strong>EM_SETPARAFORMAT</strong></a> and <a href="text-object-model.md">Text Object Model</a> (TOM) interfaces. |
| More underline types | Dashed, dash-dot, dash-dot-dot, and dot underlining has been added. |
| Underline coloring | Underlined text can be tagged with one of 15 document choices for underline colors. |
| Hidden text | Marked by CHARFORMAT2 attribute. Handy for roundtripping (writing out to a file what was read in) of information that ordinarily should not be displayed. | 
| More default hot keys | These hot keys function the same as those in Word. For example, European accent dead keys (U.S. keyboards only). Number hot key (CTRL+L) cycles through numbering options available, starting with bullet. |
| HexToUnicode IME | Allows a user to convert between hexadecimal and Unicode by using hot keys. |
| Smart quotes | This feature is toggled on and off by CTRL+ALT+' for U.S. keyboards. |
| Soft hyphens | For plain text, use 0xAD. For RTF, use \-. |
| Italics cursor | In addition, the mouse cursor changes to a hand when over URLs. |
| Advanced typography option | Microsoft Rich Edit 3.0 can use an advanced typography option for line breaking and display (see <a href="em-gettypographyoptions.md"><strong>EM_GETTYPOGRAPHYOPTIONS</strong></a>). This elegant option was added primarily to facilitate handling complex scripts (bidirectional, Indic, and Thai). In addition, a number of improvements occur for simple scripts. Examples are:<ul><li>Center, right, decimal tabs</li><li>Fully justified text</li><li>Underline averaging, which provides a uniform underline even when adjacent text runs have different font sizes.</li></ul>| 
| Complex script support | Microsoft Rich Edit 3.0 supports bidirectional (text with Arabic and/or Hebrew mixed with other scripts), Indic (Indian scripts like Devangari), and Thai text. For support of these complex scripts, the advanced typography and Uniscribe components are used.| 
| Font binding | Microsoft Rich Edit 3.0 will automatically choose an appropriate font for characters that clearly do not belong to the current character set stamp. This is done by assigning character sets to text runs and associating fonts with those character sets. For more information, see <a href="using-rich-edit-controls.md">Font Binding</a>.| 
| Plain-text read/write options specific to character sets | This allows reading a file using one character set, and writing with a different character set. |
| UTF-8 RTF | This is recommended for cutting, copying, and pasting operations. This file format is more compact than ordinary RTF, faster, and compatible with Unicode. |
| Microsoft Office 9 IME support (IME98) | This more powerful IME capability has been separated into an independent module. Features include:<ul><li>Reconversion In the earlier versions, the user needed to delete the final string first and then type in a new string to get to the correct candidate. This new feature enables the user to convert the final string back to composition mode, thereby allowing easy selection of a different candidate string.<br /></li><li>Document feed This feature provides IME98 with the text for the current paragraph, which helps IME98 perform more accurate conversion during typing.<br /></li><li>Mouse operation This feature provides better control over the candidate and UI windows during typing.<br /></li><li>Caret position This feature provides the current caret and line information, which IME98 uses to position UI windows (for example, a candidate list).<br /></li></ul>|
| Active Input Method Manager (IMM) support | Users can invoke the Active IMM object, which enables users to enter Asian characters on U.S. systems.|
| HexToUnicode support | Users can convert between hexadecimal notation and Unicode by using hot keys.|
| More RTF roundtripping | RTF text that is read in from a file will be written back out intact. |
| Improved 1.0 compatibility mode | Microsoft Rich Edit 3.0 can emulate Microsoft Rich Edit 1.0 behavior. For example, it is possible to change between MBCS and Unicode character-position (cp) mappings. | 
| Increased freeze control | The display can be frozen over multiple API calls and then unfrozen to display the updates.|
| Increased undo control | Undo can be suspended and resumed (an IME requirement).|
| Increase/decrease font size | Increases or decreases font size to one of six standard values (12, 28, 36, 48, 72, and 80 points).|




 

### Rich Edit Version 4.1
