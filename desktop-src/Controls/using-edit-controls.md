# Using Edit Controls

This section provides information and example code for implementing edit controls.

Edit controls are typically used in dialog boxes, but you can use them in the client area of a standard window as well. Single-line edit controls are useful for retrieving a single string from the user. Multiline edit controls enable you to implement most of the features of a simple word processor in your application.

The following topics are discussed.
