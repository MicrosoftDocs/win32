# Using Tab Controls

This topic contains two examples that use tab controls. The first example demonstrates how to use a tab control to switch between multiple pages of text in an application's main window. The second example demonstrates how to use a tab control to switch between multiple pages of controls in a dialog box.

| <a href="create-a-tab-control-in-the-main-window.md">How to Create a Tab Control in the Main Window</a><br /> | The example in this section demonstrates how to create a tab control and display it in the client area of the application's main window. The application displays a third window (a static control) in the display area of the tab control. The parent window positions and sizes the tab control and static control when it processes the <a href="/windows/desktop/winmsg/wm-size"><strong>WM_SIZE</strong></a> message. <br /> There are seven tabs in this example, one for each day of the week. When the user selects a tab, the application displays the name of the corresponding day in the static control. <br /> | 
| [How to Create a Tabbed Dialog Box](create-a-tabbed-dialog-box.md)<br> | The example in this section demonstrates how to create a dialog box that uses tabs to provide multiple pages of controls. The main dialog box is a modal dialog box. Each page of controls is defined by a dialog box template that has the [**WS_CHILD**](/windows/desktop/winmsg/window-styles) style. When a tab is selected, a modeless dialog box is created for the incoming page and the dialog box for the outgoing page is destroyed. <br> **Note:** In many cases, you can implement multiple-page dialog boxes more easily by using property sheets. For more information about property sheets, see [About Property Sheets](property-sheets.md).<br> The template for the main dialog box simply defines two button controls. When processing the [**WM_INITDIALOG**](/windows/desktop/dlgbox/wm-initdialog) message, the dialog box procedure creates a tab control and loads the dialog box template resources for each of the child dialog boxes. <br> |
