To complete a task, users submit the task details to the application by configuring the controls within the task dialog, and then clicking a command button (usually **OK**).

## Instructions

### Getting User Input from a Task Dialog

You can identify the button that was clicked by examining the *pnButton* parameter of the calling function. You can also identify the selected radio button from the *pnRadioButton* parameter of [**TaskDialogIndirect**](taskdialogindirect.md), and the state of the verification check box from the *pfVerificationFlagChecked* parameter.

Clicks on buttons and hyperlinks are received by the [*TaskDialogCallbackProc*](taskdialogcallbackproc.md) function in the form of [TDN\_BUTTON\_CLICKED](tdn-button-clicked.md) and [TDN\_HYPERLINK\_CLICKED](tdn-hyperlink-clicked.md) notifications. If your callback function returns S\_OK after handling a button notification, the task dialog closes and the command identifier of the button is returned in *pnButton*. If you return S\_FALSE, or do not have a callback function, the task dialog remains open.
