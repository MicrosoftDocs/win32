# Web Services on Devices

## Purpose

The Microsoft Web Services on Devices API (WSDAPI) supports the implementation of client-controlled devices and services, and device hosts conforming to the [Devices Profile for Web Services](https://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2006/02/devprof/) (DPWS). WSDAPI uses [WS-Discovery](https://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/04/discovery/ws-discovery.pdf) for device discovery.

WSDAPI may be used for the development of both client and service implementations.

## Where applicable

Web Services on Devices allows a client to discover and access a remote device and its associated services across a network. It supports device discovery, description, control, and eventing. Developers can create WSDAPI client proxies and corresponding stubs for device hosts.

## Developer audience

The Web Services on Devices documentation is intended for C/C++ programmers and device vendors creating DPWS-compliant products.

## Run-time requirements

Client applications that use WSDAPI are supported starting with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.
