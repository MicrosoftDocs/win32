# WSD Device Implementation Recommendations

The following topics are of interest to device manufacturers and other device implementers that create devices that interoperate with Windows-based WSDAPI clients and hosts without using WSDAPI. These topics contain recommendations that help reduce the complexity of device code and increase interoperability with WSDAPI.

-   [Implementing a Multi-Homed WSD Device](implementing-a-multi-homed-wsd-device.md)
-   [Dispatching SOAP Messages](dispatching-soap-messages.md)
-   [Using IPv6 Link-Local Addresses](using-ipv6-link-local-addresses.md)
-   [Using Logical and Physical Addresses](using-logical-and-physical-addresses.md)
