# WSD Device Development

Device manufacturers and other device implementers can create devices that interoperate with Windows-based WSDAPI clients and hosts without using WSDAPI.

In addition to developing the device functionality, device implementers must implement the [Devices Profile for Web Services](https://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2006/02/devprof/) (DPWS).

Whenever possible, use WSDAPI to create a Windows-based WSD client or device host application. Using WSDAPI reduces the complexity of development and saves time. For more information, see [WSD Application Development on Windows](wsd-application-development-on-windows.md).
