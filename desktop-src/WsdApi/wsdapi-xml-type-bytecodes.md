# WSDAPI XML Type Bytecodes

These bytecodes are used by WSDAPI to parse and generate XML using bytecode tables which describe complex types.

The bytecode table for a type expresses both the binary (in-memory) and XML (on-the-wire) representations of the type. A bytecode table consists of a list of operations terminated by a special operation, namely `OpEndOfTable`. An operation consists of a one-byte operation code followed by zero or more bytes of argument data.

| OpAttribute (name)                           | Matches the label token of an attribute with the indicated name. OpAttribute starts a clause that includes the subsequent clause in the table. The subsequent clause is used to match the value part of the attribute. OpAttribute clauses always appear after OpBeginElement or OpBeginAnyElement operations or after another OpAttribute clause.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| OpBeginChoice                                | OpBeginChoice starts a clause that ends with a matching OpEndChoice. Zero or more complete clauses must appear between OpBeginChoice and its matching OpEndChoice. The outer clause matches the tokens matched by any one of the inner clauses. All of the inner clauses must start with OpBeginElement except that the last one may be OpAnything. This construct corresponds to the XSD choice particle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Zero or more complete clauses must appear between OpBeginSequence and OpEndSequence. The outer clause matches the tokens matched by all the inner clauses in sequence. This construct corresponds to the XSD sequence particle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| OpBeginAll                                   | OpBeginAll starts a clause that ends with a matching OpEndAll. Zero or more complete clauses must appear between OpBeginAll and OpEndAll. The outer clause matches the tokens matched by the inner clauses in any sequence. Occurrence operators relating to each inner clause indicate how many times the tokens for each clause may occur. The default is once. Multiple occurrences of a specified clause may be intermixed with occurrences of other inner clauses. All of the inner clauses must start with OpBeginElement except that the last one may be OpAnything. This construct corresponds to the XSD all particle.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| OpFormatInt8 (type,field)                    | Matches an 8-bit signed integer in a text token.

The 'next' pointer that links the structures into a list is always the first field in the structures. The OpFormatListInsertTail macro calculates the size of the indicated structure type (nodeType) and supplies the size as the first argument. The macro calculates the offset of the indicated field in the indicated type and supplies that offset as the second argument. |
| OpFormatType (typetable,type,field)          | Matches the tokens matched by the indicated type table and indicates that the binary context for that table is embedded in the current binary context at an indicated offset. The first of two 4-byte arguments is the encoded reference to the type table. The second argument is the offset. The OpFormatType macro calculates the offset of the indicated field in the indicated type and supplies that offset as the argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| OpFormatDynamicType (name,type,field)        | Matches the tokens matched by a type table obtained dynamically using the indicated name and indicates that the binary context for that table is embedded in the current binary context at an indicated offset. The first of two 4-byte arguments is the name that identifies the type table. Typically, this name is specified in the form of a single-quoted string such as "'body'", which produces a 4-byte value. The second argument is the offset. The OpFormatDynamicType macro calculates the offset of the indicated field in the indicated type and supplies that offset as the argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| OpFormatLookupType (urifield,type,field)     | Matches the tokens matched by the type table identified by the URI at an indicated offset in the current binary context and indicates that the binary context for that table is embedded in the current binary context at an indicated offset. The first of two 4-byte arguments is the offset of the type URI in the current binary context. The second argument is the offset for the new binary context. The OpFormatLookupType macro calculates the offset of the indicated field in the indicated type and supplies that offset as the argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| OpProcess(type,field)                        | Flags the referenced field as requiring additional processing during the generation and parsing phases. This is used for complex fields that cannot be automatically be processed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
