# Using WinHTTP Logging to Verify Get Traffic

If the generic host and client succeed but the actual host and client still fail, it is possible that the metadata request is not being initiated. [WinHTTP](/windows/desktop/WinHttp/winhttp-start-page) logging can be used to verify that outbound messages are being generated and sent correctly.

WSDAPI-based client applications use [WinHTTP](/windows/desktop/WinHttp/winhttp-start-page) to connect to devices. WSDAPI-based device hosts do not use WinHTTP. Also, some third-party proxies do not use WinHTTP. When troubleshooting a host or proxy that does not use WinHTTP, skip this diagnostic procedure and continue troubleshooting by following the procedures in [Inspecting Network Traces for HTTP Metadata Exchange](inspecting-network-traces-for-http-metadata-exchange.md).

[WinHTTP](/windows/desktop/WinHttp/winhttp-start-page) logging does not show all TCP-level traffic. Skip to [Inspecting Network Traces for HTTP Metadata Exchange](inspecting-network-traces-for-http-metadata-exchange.md) if traffic besides the HTTP traffic is of interest.

**To use WinHTTP logging to verify Get traffic**

1.  [Capture the WinHTTP logs.](capturing-winhttp-logs.md)
2.  Start Notepad or another text editor. The text editor must be run as Administrator.
3.  Open the WinHTTP log file.
4.  Verify that the required HTTP requests and metadata messages were sent.

If a [Get](get--metadata-exchange--http-request-and-message.md) message for the host is found in the WinHTTP logs, then the metadata requests are being sent to WinHTTP successfully. Continue troubleshooting by following the procedures in [Inspecting Network Traces for HTTP Metadata Exchange](inspecting-network-traces-for-http-metadata-exchange.md).

If a [Get](get--metadata-exchange--http-request-and-message.md) message cannot be found for the host in the WinHTTP logs, then the metadata request is not being initiated. This can happen when the host publishes invalid XAddrs. Verify that the XAddrs on the host conform to the [XAddr validation rules](xaddr-validation-rules.md).

## Verifying that the required HTTP requests and metadata messages were sent

The following events must occur for successful metadata exchange:

-   The WSDAPI client generates an outbound HTTP request. This request is sent to the WSDAPI host.
-   The client sends a [Get](get--metadata-exchange--http-request-and-message.md) message to the host.

These events are captured in the WinHTTP logs.

The following WinHTTP log file snippet shows an outbound HTTP request generated by a WSDAPI client.

``` syntax

```

The following WinHTTP log file snippet shows a [Get](get--metadata-exchange--http-request-and-message.md) message. This message should immediately follow the HTTP request.

``` syntax

16:51:47.899 ::*0000004* :: WinHttpWriteData() returning TRUE
```

The **Action** element (`<wsa:Action>https://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/09/transfer/Get</wsa:Action>`) identifies the message as a [Get](get--metadata-exchange--http-request-and-message.md) message. Verify that the value of the **To** element (for example, `<wsa:To>urn:uuid:dbe17c74-3b21-4f52-addc-b84b444f73a0</wsa:To>`) matches the device ID advertised by the host in the original UDP WS-Discovery messages. The device ID advertised by the host can be checked by using the WSD Debug Host. For more information, see [Using a Generic Host and Client for UDP WS-Discovery](using-a-generic-host-and-client-for-udp-ws-discovery.md).

In addition, the host's response to the metadata request can be found in the client's WinHTTP logs. The host generates a [GetResponse](getresponse--metadata-exchange--message.md) message in response to the client's [Get](get--metadata-exchange--http-request-and-message.md) message.

The following WinHTTP log file snippet shows an inbound [GetResponse](getresponse--metadata-exchange--message.md) message received by a WSDAPI client.

```

The **Action** element (`<wsa:Action>https://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/09/transfer/GetResponse</wsa:Action>`) identifies the message as a [GetResponse](getresponse--metadata-exchange--message.md) message. Verify that the value of the **RelatesTo** element of the GetResponse message matches the value of the **MessageID** element of the [Get](get--metadata-exchange--http-request-and-message.md) message. In this example, the value of the **RelatesTo** element (`<wsa:RelatesTo>urn:uuid:8506ac50-3646-4621-9680-86f484d87909</wsa:RelatesTo>`) matches the value of the **MessageID** element of the Get message (`<wsa:MessageID>urn:uuid:8506ac50-3646-4621-9680-86f484d87909</wsa:MessageID>`).
