# Pointer Device Input Stack structures

The topics in this section provide the reference specifications for [Pointer Device Input Stack](pointer-device-stack-portal.md) structures.

| Topic | Description |
|---|---|
| [**POINTER_DEVICE_CURSOR_INFO**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-pointer_device_cursor_info)<br/> | Contains cursor ID mappings for pointer devices.<br/> |
| [**POINTER_DEVICE_INFO**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-pointer_device_info)<br/> | Contains information about a pointer device. An array of these structures is returned from the [**GetPointerDevices**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getpointerdevices) function. A single structure is returned from a call to the [**GetPointerDevice**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getpointerdevice) function. <br/> |
| [**POINTER_DEVICE_PROPERTY**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-pointer_device_property)<br/> | Contains device properties (Human Interface Device (HID) global items that correspond to HID usages).<br/> |
