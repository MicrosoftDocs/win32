App packager (MakeAppx.exe) creates an app package from files on disk or extracts the files from an app package to disk. Starting with Windows 8.1, App packager also creates an app package bundle from app packages on disk or extracts the app packages from an app package bundle to disk. It is included in Microsoft Visual Studio and the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 8 or Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 8.1. Visit [Downloads for developers]( https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/br229516.aspx) to get them.

The MakeAppx.exe tool is typically found at these locations:

-   On x86: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\bin\\x86\\makeappx.exe or C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.1\\bin\\x86\\makeappx.exe
-   On x64 in two locations:
    -   C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\bin\\x86\\makeappx.exe or C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.1\\bin\\x86\\makeappx.exe

## Using App packager

> [!Note]  
> Relative paths are supported throughout the tool.

 

### To create a package using a directory structure

Place the AppxManifest.xml in the root of a directory containing all of the payload files for your app. An identical directory structure is created for the app package, and will be available when the package is extracted at deployment time.

1.  Place all files in a single directory structure, creating subdirectories as desired.

2.  Create a valid package manifest, AppxManifest.xml, and place it in the root directory.

3.  Run this command:

    **MakeAppx pack /d** *input\_directorypath* **/p** _filepath_**.appx**

### To create a package using a mapping file

1.  Create a valid package manifest, AppxManifest.xml.

2.  Create a mapping file. The first line contains the string **\[Files\]**, and the lines that follow specify the source (disk) and destination (package) paths in quoted strings.

    ``` syntax
    [Files]
    "C:\MyApp\StartPage.htm"     "default.html"
    "C:\MyApp\readme.txt"        "doc\readme.txt"
    "\\MyServer\path\icon.png"   "icon.png"
    "MyCustomManifest.xml"       "AppxManifest.xml"
    ```

3.  Run this command:

    **MakeAppx pack /f** *mapping\_filepath* **/p** _filepath_**.appx**

### To sign the package using SignTool

1.  Create the certificate. The publisher listed in the manifest must match the publisher subject information of the signing certificate. For more info about creating a signing certificate, see [How to create an app package signing certificate](how-to-create-a-package-signing-certificate.md).

2.  Run SignTool.exe to sign the package:

    **SignTool sign /a /v /fd** *hashAlgorithm* **/f** *certFileName* _filepath_**.appx**

    The *hashAlgorithm* must match the hash algorithm used to create the blockmap when the app was packaged. With the MakeAppx packaging utility, the default Appx blockmap hash algorithm is **SHA256**. Run SignTool.exe specifying **SHA256** as the file digest (/fd) algorithm:

    **SignTool sign /a /v /fd SHA256 /f** *certFileName* _filepath_**.appx**

    For more info about how to sign packages, see [How to sign an app package using SignTool](how-to-sign-a-package-using-signtool.md).

### To extract files from a package

1.  Run this command:

    **MakeAppx unpack /p** _file_**.appx /d** *output\_directory*

2.  The unpacked package has the same structure as the installed package.

### To create a package bundle using a directory structure

We use the **bundle** command to create an app bundle at <output bundle name> by adding all packages from <content directory> (including subfolders). If <content directory> contains a bundle manifest, AppxBundleManifest.xml, it is ignored.

1.  Place all packages in a single directory structure, creating subdirectories as desired.

2.  Run this command:

    **MakeAppx bundle /d** *input\_directorypath* **/p** _filepath_**.appxbundle**

### To create a package bundle using a mapping file

We use the **bundle** command to create an app bundle at <output bundle name> by adding all packages from a list of packages within <mapping file>. If <mapping file> contains a bundle manifest, AppxBundleManifest.xml, it is ignored.

1.  Create a <mapping file>. The first line contains the string **\[Files\]**, and the lines that follow specify the packages to add to the bundle. Each package is described by a pair of paths in quotation marks, separated by spaces or tabs. The pair of paths represents the package's source (on disk) and destination (in bundle). All destination package names must have the .appx extension.

    ``` syntax
        [Files]
        "C:\MyApp\MyApp_x86.appx"                 "MyApp_x86.appx"
        "C:\Program Files (x86)\ResPack.appx"    "resources\resPack.appx"
        "\\MyServer\path\ResPack.appx"           "Respack.appx"
        "my app files\respack.appx"              "my app files\respack.appx"
    ```

2.  Run this command:

    **MakeAppx bundle /f** *mapping\_filepath* **/p** _filepath_**.appxbundle**

### To extract packages from a bundle

1.  Run this command:

    **MakeAppx unbundle /p** _bundle\_name_**.appxbundle /d** *output\_directory*

2.  The unpacked bundle has the same structure as the installed package bundle.

### To encrypt a package with a key file

1.  Create a key file. Key files must begin with a line containing the string "\[Keys\]" followed by lines describing the keys to encrypt the package with. Each key is described by a pair of strings in quotation marks, separated by spaces or tabs. The first string represents the key ID and the second string represents the encryption key in hexadecimal form.

    ``` syntax
        [Keys]
        "0"                 "1AC4CDCFF1924D2885A0607269787BA6BF09B7FFEBF74ED4B9D86E423CF9186B"
    ```

2.  Run this command:

    **MakeAppx.exe encrypt /p** _package\_name_**.appx /ep** _encrypted\_package\_name_**.eappx /kf** _keyfile\_name_**.txt**

3.  The input package will be encrypted into the specified encrypted package using the provided key file.

### To encrypt a package with a global test key

1.  Run this command:

    **MakeAppx.exe encrypt /p** _package\_name_**.appx /ep** _encrypted\_package\_name_**.eappx /kt**

2.  The input package will be encrypted into the specified encrypted package using the global test key.

### To decrypt a package with a key file

1.  Create a key file. Key files must begin with a line containing the string "\[Keys\]" followed by lines describing the keys to encrypt the package with. Each key is described by a pair of strings in quotation marks, separated by spaces or tabs. The first string represents the base64 encoded 32-byte key ID and the second string represents the base64 encoded 32-byte encryption key.

    ``` syntax
        [Keys]
        "OWVwSzliRGY1VWt1ODk4N1Q4R2Vqc04zMzIzNnlUREU="                 "MjNFTlFhZGRGZEY2YnVxMTBocjd6THdOdk9pZkpvelc="
    ```

2.  Run this command:

    **MakeAppx.exe decrypt /p** _package\_name_**.appx /ep** _unencrypted\_package\_name_**.eappx /kf** _keyfile\_name_**.txt**

3.  The input package will be decrypted into the specified unencrypted package using the provided key file.

### To decrypt a package with a global test key

1.  Run this command:

    **MakeAppx.exe decrypt /p** _package\_name_**.appx /ep** _unencrypted\_package\_name_**.eappx /kt**

2.  The input package will be decrypted into the specified unencrypted package using the global test key.

**MakeAppx \[pack\|unpack\|bundle\|unbundle\|encrypt\|decrypt\]** \[**/h** **/kf** **/kt** **/l** **/o** **/no** **/nv** **/v** **/pfn** **/?**\]

**MakeAppx** packs or unpacks the files in a package, bundles or unbundles the packages in a bundle, or encrypts or decrypts the app package or bundle in the specified input directory or mapping file. Here is the list of parameters that apply to **MakeAppx pack**, **MakeAppx unpack**, **MakeAppx bundle**, **MakeAppx unbundle**, **MakeAppx encrypt**, or **MakeAppx decrypt**.

<dl> <dt>

## Semantic validation performed by MakeAppx

MakeAppx performs limited semantic validation that is designed to catch the most common deployment errors and help ensure that the app package is valid.

This validation ensures that:

-   All files referenced in the package manifest are included in the app package.
-   An application does not have two identical keys.
-   An application does not register for a forbidden protocol from this list: SMB , FILE, MS-WWA-WEB, MS-WWA.

This semantic validation is not complete, and packages built by MakeAppx are not guaranteed to be installable.
