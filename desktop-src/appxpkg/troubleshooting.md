# Troubleshooting packaging, deployment, and query of Windows apps

Use these suggestions to troubleshoot problems you experience when packaging, deploying, or querying an app package.

## Get diagnostic info

When an API fails, it returns an error code that describes the problem.

If the error code doesn't provide enough info, you can get detailed event logs that provide more info to help you diagnose the cause of the problem.

**To access the packaging and deployment event logs**

1.  Run **eventvwr.msc**.
2.  Go to **Event Viewer (Local)** > **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows**.
3.  The first log to check is **AppxPackagingOM** > **Microsoft-Windows-AppxPackaging/Operational**.
4.  Deployment-related errors are recorded in **AppXDeployment-Server** > **Microsoft-Windows-AppXDeploymentServer/Operational**.

You can also use the following command in PowerShell to get the first few logged events:

**Get-Appxlog \| Out-GridView**

## Common error codes

This table lists the most common error codes.
