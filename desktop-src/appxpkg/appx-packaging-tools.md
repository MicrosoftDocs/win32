# Packaging and deployment tools and PowerShell cmdlets

Use these tools and cmdlets to create, deploy, and inventory app packages for Windows apps.

## App packaging tools and guidance

Learn how to package an app, create a test certificate, and sign your app using the Command Prompt and PowerShell. For more info, see:

-   [Create an app package with the MakeAppx.exe tool](/windows/msix/package/create-app-package-with-makeappx-tool)
-   [Create a certificate for package signing](/windows/msix/package/create-certificate-package-signing)
-   [Sign an app package using SignTool](/windows/msix/package/sign-app-package-using-signtool)

Alternatively, you can use Visual Studio to create and sign an app package. For more info, see [Package a UWP app with Visual Studio](/windows/msix/package/packaging-uwp-apps).

## PowerShell cmdlets

Use Windows PowerShell to install, inventory, and uninstall line-of-business (LOB) Windows apps that are not Store-signed. For more info, see: [Appx Module Cmdlets](/powershell/module/appx/index).
