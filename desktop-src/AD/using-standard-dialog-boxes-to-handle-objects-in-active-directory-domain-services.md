# Using Standard Dialog Boxes to Handle Objects in Active Directory Domain Services

Windows provides a Common Dialog Box library for common operations, such as File Open, File Browse, and so on. Beginning with Windows 2000, the system provides dialog boxes that can be used for common user interface operations in Active Directory Domain Services.

The following dialog boxes are available for use with Active Directory Domain Services:

-   [Directory Object Picker](directory-object-picker.md)
-   [Domain Browser](domain-browser.md)
-   [Container Browser](container-browser.md)
-   [Active Directory Users and Computers Property Sheets](active-directory-users-and-computers-property-sheets.md)

In addition, Active Directory Domain Services creation wizards can also be invoked from an application. For more information, see [Invoking Creation Wizards from Your Application](invoking-creation-wizards-from-your-application.md).
