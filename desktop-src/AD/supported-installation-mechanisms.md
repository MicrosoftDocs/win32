# Supported Installation Mechanisms

Active Directory Domain Services support four mechanisms for extending the Active Directory schema. You can extend the Active Directory schema by using

-   [LDIF Scripts](ldif-scripts.md) (preferred)
-   [Comma-separated Value (CSV) Scripts](comma-separated-value-csv-scripts.md)
-   [Programmatic Extension](programmatic-extension.md)
-   and by [Extending the User Interface for Directory Objects](extending-the-user-interface-for-directory-objects.md).
