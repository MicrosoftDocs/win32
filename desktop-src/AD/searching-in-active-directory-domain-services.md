# Searching in Active Directory Domain Services

Search is a key feature of Active Directory Domain Services. Search enables you to find objects in the directory based on selection criteria (query) and to retrieve specified properties for the objects found.

Searching within Active Directory Domain Services is a matter of finding a Domain Controller (DC), binding to the object where the search should begin in the directory, submitting a query, and processing the results.
