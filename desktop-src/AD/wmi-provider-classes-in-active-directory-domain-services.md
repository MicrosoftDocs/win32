# WMI Provider Classes in Active Directory Domain Services

Active Directory Domain Services have the following classes for use with WMI scripting:

-   [**MSAD\_DomainController**](msad-domaincontroller.md)
-   [**MSAD\_NamingContext**](msad-namingcontext.md)
-   [**MSAD\_ReplCursor**](msad-replcursor.md)
-   [**MSAD\_ReplNeighbor**](msad-replneighbor.md)
-   [**MSAD\_ReplPendingOp**](msad-replpendingop.md)

The provider itself is represented by the [**ReplicationProvider1**](replicationprovider1.md) class, which is instanced with the name "ReplProv1".
