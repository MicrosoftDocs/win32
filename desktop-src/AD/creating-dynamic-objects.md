# Creating Dynamic Objects

Specify the auxiliary class **dynamicObject** as a value for the **objectClass** attribute at the time of instantiating an object. In this case, the special auxiliary class will show up in the list of classes that is the value of the **objectClass** attribute for the object. If a value for the **entryTTL** attribute is not supplied at the time of adding the special auxiliary class, a default value, as specified later, will be provided by Active Directory Domain Services.

For more information about adding an auxiliary class to an object, see [Dynamic Auxiliary Classes](dynamic-auxiliary-classes.md).
