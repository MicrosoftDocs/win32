# Nesting a Group in Another Group

Adding a group as a member of another group is called *nesting*. For distribution groups, nesting is supported in both mixed mode and native mode. For security groups, nesting is supported only for domains running in native mode.

To nest a group in another group, use the same techniques described in [Adding Members to Groups in a Domain](adding-members-to-groups-in-a-domain.md). Be aware that depending on the scope of the group, the group can contain only specific types and scopes of other groups.

The nesting options also depend on whether the domain is in mixed mode or native mode. For more information about groups in different domain modes, see [Nesting in Native Mode](nesting-in-native-mode.md) and [Nesting in Mixed Mode](nesting-in-mixed-mode.md).

For more information about nesting of groups, see [Common Errors](common-errors.md).
