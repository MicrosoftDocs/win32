# Documenting Schema Extensions

In addition to providing a separate installation procedure for schema extensions, the nature of the schema extensions must be clearly documented. The documentation should contain:

-   A list of any new classes and attributes with an explanation of each one
-   A list of any standard classes that are extended with new attributes and a list of the attributes
-   A list of any new property pages with an explanation of how to use each one
-   An explanation of how the service uses the schema extensions
