# Storing Dynamic Data

Most data stored using Active Directory Domain Services is static. For example, directory objects that represent users, groups, printers, network services, and so on, are typically long-lived and infrequently changed.

In Windows Server 2003 and later versions of Windows, Active Directory Domain Services provide support for the following features that enable applications to use the directory for storing dynamic data:

-   [Dynamic Objects](dynamic-objects.md)
-   [Dynamic Auxiliary Classes](dynamic-auxiliary-classes.md)
