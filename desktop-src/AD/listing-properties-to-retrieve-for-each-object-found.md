# Deciding Which Attributes to Retrieve for Each Object Found

If you search for objects of a particular class, it seems logical that you retrieve attributes that actually exist on the objects of that class. Follow the same rules discussed in [Finding a List of Attributes To Query](finding-a-list-of-attributes-to-query.md). Be aware that constructed attributes can be retrieved in query, but constructed attributes cannot be used in filters.
