# Access Rights for Active Directory Domain Services Objects

All directory objects use the same set of predefined access rights that correspond to the common directory operations. These rights are described in the [**ADS\_RIGHTS\_ENUM**](/windows/win32/api/iads/ne-iads-ads_rights_enum) enumeration type.

In addition, you can define private access rights (control access rights) for operations that go beyond those covered by the predefined rights. See [Control Access Rights](control-access-rights.md).
