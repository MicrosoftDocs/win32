# Obtaining a Root OID from an ISO Name Registration Authority

The preferred way to obtain a root object identifier (OID) is to request one from an International Standards Organization (ISO) Name Registration Authority. This is a one-time action; when you have obtained a root OID, the OID space it defines is yours and you can administer it yourself.

There is usually a fee associated with registering an organization name and receiving a root OID. Fees and registration policies vary by country/region. In the United States, the ISO NRA is the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). For more information about the ANSI registration procedure and fee schedule, see https://ansi.org. The ISO maintains a list of member organizations at https://www.iso.org. If you are outside the United States, you should contact the ISO member organization for your country/region for name registration information.

Regardless of the source used to get the OID, if you intend to extend the Active Directory schema and wish to apply for the Certified for Windows logo, you must register your OID with Microsoft. For more information about how to register your OID with Microsoft, see [Obtaining an Object Identifier from Microsoft](obtaining-an-object-identifier-from-microsoft.md).
