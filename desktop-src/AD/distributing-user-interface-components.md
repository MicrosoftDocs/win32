# Distributing User Interface Components

The COM components, applications and/or files used by a user interface extension can be distributed by creating a Windows Installer package and using a group policy to distribute the package. For more information about creating the Installer package, see [Windows Installer](/windows/desktop/Msi/windows-installer-portal). For more information about group policies, see [Group Policy](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/Policy/group-policy-start-page).
