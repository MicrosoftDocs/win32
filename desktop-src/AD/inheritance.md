# Inheritance (AD DS)

[*Inheritance*](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms681910(v=vs.85)) allows a given ACE to be propagated from the container where it was applied to all children of the container. Inheritance can be combined with delegation to grant administrative rights to a whole subtree of the directory in a single operation.
