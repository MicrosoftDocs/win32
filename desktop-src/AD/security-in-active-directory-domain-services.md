# Security in Active Directory Domain Services

Active Directory Domain Services are part of the Windows 2000 trusted computing base and are a full participant in the Windows 2000 security infrastructure. Every object in an Active Directory Server is protected by its own security descriptor. The system validates any attempt to access an object or attribute in an Active Directory Server by verifying the access rights granted by the object security descriptor.

The following topics discuss important elements of security in Active Directory Domain Services:

-   [Object and Attribute Protection](object-and-attribute-protection.md)
-   [Delegation](delegation.md)
-   [Inheritance](inheritance.md)

For more information and code examples, see [Controlling Access to Objects in Active Directory Domain Services](controlling-access-to-objects-in-active-directory-domain-services.md).
