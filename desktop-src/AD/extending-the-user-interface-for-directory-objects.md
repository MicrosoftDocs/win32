# Extending the User Interface for Directory Objects

With Microsoft Windows 2000 and later, Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-ins, such as the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in, for administration of Active Directory Domain Services, are available. In addition, the Windows 2000 shell includes user interfaces (UIs) for finding objects that reside in the directory and reading and writing properties. This section explains how to extend the UI for viewing and managing Active Directory Domain Services objects in the Windows shell and Active Directory administrative snap-ins. This section also covers what is required to deploy the UI extensions to the user's desktops.

Specifically, this section discusses the following:
