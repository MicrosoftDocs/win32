# Using TraceLogging

The following topics provide a TraceLogging quick start for C/C++ and .NET code,
with examples.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 Software Development Kit (SDK) is required to write a user-mode
  provider
- Windows Driver Kit (WDK) is required to write a kernel-mode provider

## In this section

- [**TraceLogging C/C++ Quick Start**](tracelogging-native-quick-start.md)

  This topic describes the basic steps required to add TraceLogging to C or C++
  user-mode code.

- [**TraceLogging .NET Quick Start**](tracelogging-managed-quick-start.md)

  This topic describes the basic steps required to add TraceLogging to .NET
  code.

- [**Record and Display TraceLogging Events**](tracelogging-record-and-display-tracelogging-events.md)

  Record TraceLogging events with the Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) and
  view them with the Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA).

- [**C/C++ Tracelogging Examples**](tracelogging-c-cpp-tracelogging-examples.md)

  This topic contains C/C++ Tracelogging examples.

- [**.NET Tracelogging Examples**](tracelogging-net-examples.md)

  This topic contains a .NET Tracelogging example that illustrates how to log an
  event only when the session verbosity level is verbose, and how to log
  structured event data.

- [**Universal Windows Platform Logging Example**](universal-windows-platform-logging-examples.md)

  This sample shows how to use the Logging APIs in the
  Windows.Foundation.Diagnostics namespace, including LoggingChannel,
  LoggingActivity, LoggingSession, and FileLoggingSession. These classes are
  designed for diagnostic logging within a Windows app. These APIs were added in
  Windows 8.1.

  The LoggingChannel and LoggingActivity APIs have been extended in Windows 10
  to support writing complex events using TraceLogging event encoding.

  The Universal Windows Platform logging example can downloaded from
  [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/Logging).
