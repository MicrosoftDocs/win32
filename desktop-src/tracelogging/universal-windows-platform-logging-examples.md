# Universal Windows Platform Logging Example

This sample shows how to use the Logging APIs in the
Windows.Foundation.Diagnostics namespace, including LoggingChannel,
LoggingActivity, LoggingSession, and FileLoggingSession. These classes are
designed for diagnostic logging within a Windows app. These APIs were added in
Windows 8.1.

The LoggingChannel and LoggingActivity APIs have been extended in Windows 10 to
support writing complex events using TraceLogging event encoding.

The Universal Windows Platform logging example can downloaded from
[GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/Logging).
