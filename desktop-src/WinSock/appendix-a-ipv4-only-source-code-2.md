# Appendix A: IPv4-only Source Code

This appendix provides the source code for the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) samples Simplec.c and Simples.c, which are used throughout this IPv6 guide as examples:

-   [IPv4-only Client Code](ipv4-only-client-code-2.md)
-   [IPv4-only Server Code](ipv4-only-server-code-2.md)

> [!WARNING]
>
> This code is included in this guide to contrast the IP-version agnostic code provided in Appendix B. This sample code is provided for comparison purposes, and to provide a clear and readily available reference while reading this IPv6 guide. An IP version agnostic version of this source code is provided in [Appendix B: IP-version Agnostic Source Code](appendix-b-ip-version-agnostic-source-code-2.md).

 

> [!Note]  
> By comparing the source code in Appendix A (IPv4 only) and Appendix B (IP version agnostic), you get a sense of the changes necessary to modify your Windows Sockets application to add support for IPv6.
