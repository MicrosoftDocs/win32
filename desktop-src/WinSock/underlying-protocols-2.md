# Underlying Protocols for IPv6 Winsock Applications

Some protocols that your application depends on for certain services, such as Remote Procedure Call (RPC), may have IP-version dependent functions and structures that require you to modify your application in terms of their usage.

Part of the process to modify your code to support IPv6 should include determining whether the use of the underlying protocols (from the perspective of the stack, these protocols are considered higher-layer protocols) require modification in order to properly make use of IPv6.
