# Multicast

Generic Winsock multipoint functions support IP multicast. However, the TCP/IP transport providers that support multicast must also provide Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) style–multicast support by supporting the corresponding multicast options. This simplifies the porting of existing multicast applications to Windows Sockets 2.
