# SIO_APPLY_TRANSPORT_SETTING Control Code

## Description

The **SIO\_APPLY\_TRANSPORT\_SETTING** control code applies one or more transport settings to a socket.

To perform this operation, call the [**WSAIoctl**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl) or **WSPIoctl** function with the following parameters.

```cpp
int WSAIoctl(
  (socket) s,             // descriptor identifying a socket
  SIO_APPLY_TRANSPORT_SETTING, // dwIoControlCode
  (LPVOID) lpvInBuffer,  // pointer to the input buffer
  (DWORD) cbInBuffer,    // size, in bytes, of the input buffer
  (LPVOID) lpvOutBuffer,             // pointer to the output buffer
  (DWORD) cbOutBuffer,   // size, in bytes, of the output buffer
  (LPDWORD) lpcbBytesReturned,    // number of bytes returned
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED) lpOverlapped,   // OVERLAPPED structure
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE) lpCompletionRoutine,  // completion routine
);
```

```cpp
int WSPIoctl(
  (socket) s,             // descriptor identifying a socket
  SIO_APPLY_TRANSPORT_SETTING, // dwIoControlCode
  (LPVOID) lpvInBuffer,  // pointer to the input buffer
  (DWORD) cbInBuffer,    // size, in bytes, of the input buffer
  (LPVOID) lpvOutBuffer,             // pointer to the output buffer
  (DWORD) cbOutBuffer,   // size, in bytes, of the output buffer
  (LPDWORD) lpcbBytesReturned,    // number of bytes returned
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED) lpOverlapped,   // OVERLAPPED structure
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE) lpCompletionRoutine,  // completion routine
  (LPWSATHREADID) lpThreadId,   // a WSATHREADID structure
  (LPINT) lpErrno   // a pointer to the error code.
);
```

## Parameters

### s

A descriptor identifying a socket.

### dwIoControlCode

The control code for the operation.
Use **SIO\_APPLY\_TRANSPORT\_SETTING** for this operation.

### lpvInBuffer

A pointer to the input buffer.
This parameter contains a pointer to a structure where the first member of the structure is a [**TRANSPORT_SETTING_ID**](/windows/desktop/api/mstcpip/ns-mstcpip-transport_setting_id) structure that determines what transport setting is being applied.

### cbInBuffer

The size, in bytes, of the input buffer.
This parameter depends on the transport setting being applied.

### lpvOutBuffer

A pointer to the output buffer.
This parameter depends on the transport setting being applied.

### cbOutBuffer

The size, in bytes, of the output buffer.

### lpcbBytesReturned

A pointer to a variable that receives the size, in bytes, of the data stored in the output buffer.

If the output buffer is too small, the call fails, [**WSAGetLastError**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsagetlasterror) returns [**WSAEINVAL**](windows-sockets-error-codes-2.md), and the *lpcbBytesReturned* parameter points to a **DWORD** value of zero.

If *lpOverlapped* is **NULL**, the **DWORD** value pointed to by the *lpcbBytesReturned* parameter that is returned on a successful call cannot be zero.

If the *lpOverlapped* parameter is not **NULL** for overlapped sockets, operations that cannot be completed immediately will be initiated, and completion will be indicated at a later time.
The **DWORD** value pointed to by the *lpcbBytesReturned* parameter that is returned may be zero since the size of the data stored can't be determined until the overlapped operation has completed.
The final completion status can be retrieved when the appropriate completion method is signaled when the operation has completed.

### lpvOverlapped

A pointer to a [**WSAOVERLAPPED**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped) structure.

If socket *s* was created without the overlapped attribute, the *lpOverlapped* parameter is ignored.

If *s* was opened with the overlapped attribute and the *lpOverlapped* parameter is not **NULL**, the operation is performed as an overlapped (asynchronous) operation.
In this case, *lpOverlapped* parameter must point to a valid [**WSAOVERLAPPED**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped) structure.

For overlapped operations, the [**WSAIoctl**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl) or **WSPIoctl** function returns immediately, and the appropriate completion method is signaled when the operation has been completed.
Otherwise, the function does not return until the operation has been completed or an error occurs.

### lpCompletionRoutine

Type: \_In_opt\_ [**LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE**](/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nc-winsock2-lpwsaoverlapped_completion_routine)

A pointer to the completion routine called when the operation has been completed (ignored for non-overlapped sockets).

### lpThreadId

A pointer to a [**WSATHREADID**](/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/ns-ws2spi-wsathreadid) structure to be used by the provider in a subsequent call to [**WPUQueueApc**](/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wpuqueueapc).
The provider should store the referenced [**WSATHREADID**](/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/ns-ws2spi-wsathreadid) structure (not the pointer to same) until after the [**WPUQueueApc**](/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wpuqueueapc) function returns.

**Note**  This parameter applies only to the **WSPIoctl** function.

### lpErrno

A pointer to the error code.

**Note**  This parameter applies only to the **WSPIoctl** function.

## Return value

If the operation completes successfully, the [**WSAIoctl**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl) or **WSPIoctl** function returns zero.

If the operation fails or is pending, the [**WSAIoctl**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl) or **WSPIoctl** function returns **SOCKET\_ERROR**.
To get extended error information, call [**WSAGetLastError**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsagetlasterror).

| Error code | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
|**WSA\_IO\_PENDING** | Overlapped I/O operation is in progress. This value is returned if an overlapped operation was successfully initiated and completion will be indicated at a later time. |
| **WSA\_OPERATION\_ABORTED** | The I/O operation has been aborted because of either a thread exit or an application request. This error is returned if an overlapped operation was canceled due to the closure of the socket or the execution of the **SIO\_FLUSH** IOCTL command. |
| **WSAEFAULT** | The system detected an invalid pointer address in attempting to use a pointer argument in a call. This error is returned of the *lpvInBuffer*, *lpvoutBuffer*, *lpcbBytesReturned*, *lpOverlapped* or *lpCompletionRoutine* parameter is not totally contained in a valid part of the user address space. |
| **WSAEINPROGRESS** | A blocking operation is currently executing. This error is returned if the function is invoked when a callback is in progress. |
| **WSAEINTR** | A blocking operation was interrupted by a call to [**WSACancelBlockingCall**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsacancelblockingcall). This error is returned if a blocking operation was interrupted. |
| **WSAEINVAL** | An invalid argument was supplied. This error is returned if the *dwIoControlCode* parameter is not a valid command, or a specified input parameter is not acceptable, or the command is not applicable to the type of socket specified. |
| **WSAENETDOWN** | A socket operation encountered a dead network. This error is returned if the network subsystem has failed. |
| **WSAENOTSOCK** | An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket. This error is returned if the descriptor *s* is not a socket. |
| **WSAEOPNOTSUPP** | The attempted operation is not supported for the type of object referenced. This error is returned if the specified IOCTL command is not supported. This error is also returned if the **SIO\_APPLY\_TRANSPORT\_SETTING** IOCTL is not supported by the transport provider. This error is also returned when an attempt to use the **SIO\_APPLY\_TRANSPORT\_SETTING** IOCTL is made on a socket other than UDP or TCP. |

## Remarks

The **SIO\_APPLY\_TRANSPORT\_SETTING** IOCTL is supported on Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012, and later versions of the operating system.

The **SIO\_APPLY\_TRANSPORT\_SETTING** IOCTL is a generic IOCTL used to apply transport setting to socket.
The transport setting being applied is based on the [**TRANSPORT_SETTING_ID**](/windows/desktop/api/mstcpip/ns-mstcpip-transport_setting_id) passed in the *lpvInBuffer* parameter.

Starting with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the system defines the **REAL_TIME_NOTIFICATION_CAPABILITY** capability on a TCP socket.
Starting with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016, **ASSOCIATE\_NAMERES\_CONTEXT** is also defined.
For more information, see [**addrinfoex4**](/windows/desktop/api/ws2def/ns-ws2def-addrinfoex4) and [**ASSOCIATE_NAMERES_CONTEXT_INPUT**](/windows/desktop/api/mstcpip/ns-mstcpip-associate_nameres_context_input).

If the [**TRANSPORT_SETTING_ID**](/windows/desktop/api/mstcpip/ns-mstcpip-transport_setting_id) passed in the lpvInBuffer parameter has the Guid member set to **REAL\_TIME\_NOTIFICATION\_CAPABILITY**, then this is a request to apply real time notification settings for the TCP socket used with the [**ControlChannelTrigger**](/uwp/api/Windows.Networking.Sockets.ControlChannelTrigger) to receive background network notifications in a Windows Store app.
The *lpvInBuffer* parameter should point to a **REAL_TIME_NOTIFICATION_SETTING_INPUT** structure.
The *lpvOutBuffer* parameter is unused for this operation.
This transport setting applies only to TCP sockets.
This transport setting provides a way for WinInet or similar network services to mark a given TCP socket as [**ControlChannelTrigger**](/uwp/api/Windows.Networking.Sockets.ControlChannelTrigger) enabled.
Windows will mark the corresponding TCP socket and configure appropriate hardware and software settings when this option is called.
A Windows Store app will not call this IOCTL directly.
