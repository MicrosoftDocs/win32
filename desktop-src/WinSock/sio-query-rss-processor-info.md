# SIO_QUERY_RSS_PROCESSOR_INFO Control Code

## Description

The **SIO\_QUERY\_RSS\_PROCESSOR\_INFO** control code queries the association between a socket and an RSS processor core and NUMA node.

To perform this operation, call the [**WSAIoctl**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl) or **WSPIoctl** function with the following parameters.

```cpp
int WSAIoctl(
  (socket) s,             // descriptor identifying a socket
  SIO_QUERY_RSS_PROCESSOR_INFO, // dwIoControlCode
  NULL,                         // lpvInBuffer
  0,                            // cbInBuffer
  (LPVOID) lpvOutBuffer,         // output buffer
  (DWORD) cbOutBuffer,       // size of output buffer
  (LPDWORD) lpcbBytesReturned,    // number of bytes returned
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED) lpOverlapped,   // OVERLAPPED structure
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE) lpCompletionRoutine,  // completion routine
);
```

```cpp
int WSPIoctl(
  (socket) s,             // descriptor identifying a socket
  SIO_QUERY_RSS_PROCESSOR_INFO, // dwIoControlCode
  NULL,                         // lpvInBuffer
  0,                            // cbInBuffer
  (LPVOID) lpvOutBuffer,         // output buffer
  (DWORD) cbOutBuffer,       // size of output buffer
  (LPDWORD) lpcbBytesReturned,    // number of bytes returned
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED) lpOverlapped,   // OVERLAPPED structure
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE) lpCompletionRoutine,  // completion routine
  (LPWSATHREADID) lpThreadId,   // a WSATHREADID structure
  (LPINT) lpErrno   // a pointer to the error code.
);
```

## Parameters

### s

A descriptor identifying a socket.

### dwIoControlCode

The control code for the operation.
Use **SIO\_QUERY\_RSS\_PROCESSOR\_INFO** for this operation.

### lpvInBuffer

A pointer to the input buffer.
This parameter is unused for this operation.

### cbInBuffer

The size, in bytes, of the input buffer.
This parameter is unused for this operation.

### lpvOutBuffer

A pointer to the output buffer.
This parameter should point to a [**SOCKET\_PROCESSOR\_AFFINITY**](/windows/desktop/api/Ws2def/ns-ws2def-socket_processor_affinity) structure if the *lpOverlapped* and *lpCompletionRoutine* parameters are **NULL**.

### cbOutBuffer

The size, in bytes, of the output buffer.
This parameter must be at least the size of a [**SOCKET\_PROCESSOR\_AFFINITY**](/windows/desktop/api/Ws2def/ns-ws2def-socket_processor_affinity) structure.

### lpcbBytesReturned

A pointer to a variable that receives the size, in bytes, of the data stored in the output buffer.

If the output buffer is too small, the call fails, [**WSAGetLastError**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsagetlasterror) returns [**WSAEINVAL**](windows-sockets-error-codes-2.md), and the *lpcbBytesReturned* parameter points to a *DWORD* value of zero.

If *lpOverlapped* is **NULL**, the **DWORD** value pointed to by the *lpcbBytesReturned* parameter that is returned on a successful call cannot be zero.

If the *lpOverlapped* parameter is not **NULL** for overlapped sockets, operations that cannot be completed immediately will be initiated, and completion will be indicated at a later time.
The **DWORD** value pointed to by the *lpcbBytesReturned* parameter that is returned may be zero since the size of the data stored can't be determined until the overlapped operation has completed.
The final completion status can be retrieved when the appropriate completion method is signaled when the operation has completed.

### lpvOverlapped

A pointer to a [**WSAOVERLAPPED**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped) structure.

If socket *s* was created without the overlapped attribute, the *lpOverlapped* parameter is ignored.

If *s* was opened with the overlapped attribute and the *lpOverlapped* parameter is not **NULL**, the operation is performed as an overlapped (asynchronous) operation.
In this case, *lpOverlapped* parameter must point to a valid [**WSAOVERLAPPED**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped) structure.

For overlapped operations, the [**WSAIoctl**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl) or **WSPIoctl** function returns immediately, and the appropriate completion method is signaled when the operation has been completed.
Otherwise, the function does not return until the operation has been completed or an error occurs.

### lpCompletionRoutine

Type: \_In_opt\_ [**LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE**](/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nc-winsock2-lpwsaoverlapped_completion_routine)

A pointer to the completion routine called when the operation has been completed (ignored for non-overlapped sockets).

### lpThreadId

A pointer to a [**WSATHREADID**](/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/ns-ws2spi-wsathreadid) structure to be used by the provider in a subsequent call to [**WPUQueueApc**](/windows/desktop/api/Ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wpuqueueapc).
The provider should store the referenced [**WSATHREADID**](/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/ns-ws2spi-wsathreadid) structure (not the pointer to same) until after the [**WPUQueueApc**](/windows/desktop/api/Ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wpuqueueapc) function returns.

**Note**  This parameter applies only to the **WSPIoctl** function.

### lpErrno

A pointer to the error code.

**Note**  This parameter applies only to the **WSPIoctl** function.

## Return value

If the operation completes successfully, the [**WSAIoctl**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl) or **WSPIoctl** function returns zero.

If the operation fails or is pending, the [**WSAIoctl**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl) or **WSPIoctl** function returns **SOCKET\_ERROR**.
To get extended error information, call [**WSAGetLastError**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsagetlasterror).

| Error code | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| **ERROR\_INSUFFICIENT\_BUFFER** | The data area passed to a system call is too small. This error is returned if the buffer pointed to by the *lpvOutBuffer* parameter with a buffer size passed in the *cbOutBuffer* parameter is too small. The buffer size required will be returned in the *lpcbBytesReturned* parameter. This error is returned if the *cbOutBuffer* parameter is less than the size of a [**SOCKET\_PROCESSOR\_AFFINITY**](/windows/desktop/api/Ws2def/ns-ws2def-socket_processor_affinity) structure. |
| **WSA\_IO\_PENDING** | An overlapped operation was successfully initiated and completion will be indicated at a later time. |
| **WSA\_OPERATION\_ABORTED** | An overlapped operation was canceled due to the closure of the socket or the execution of the **SIO\_FLUSH** IOCTL command. |
| **WSAEFAULT** | The *lpvInBuffer*, *lpvoutBuffer*, *lpcbBytesReturned*, *lpOverlapped* or *lpCompletionRoutine* parameter is not totally contained in a valid part of the user address space. |
| **WSAEINPROGRESS** | The function is invoked when a callback is in progress. |
| **WSAEINTR** | A blocking operation was interrupted. |
| **WSAEINVAL** | The *dwIoControlCode* parameter is not a valid command, or a specified input parameter is not acceptable, or the command is not applicable to the type of socket specified. This error is returned if the *cbOutBuffer* parameter is less than the size of a [**SOCKET\_PROCESSOR\_AFFINITY**](/windows/desktop/api/Ws2def/ns-ws2def-socket_processor_affinity) structure.
| **WSAENETDOWN** | The network subsystem has failed. |
| **WSAENOPROTOOPT** | The socket option is not supported on the specified protocol. |
| **WSAENOTCONN** | The socket *s* is not connected. |
| **WSAENOTSOCK** | The descriptor *s* is not a socket. |
| **WSAEOPNOTSUPP** | The specified IOCTL command is not supported. This error is returned if the **SIO\_QUERY\_RSS\_PROCESSOR\_INFO** IOCTL is not supported by the transport provider. |

## Remarks

The **SIO\_QUERY\_RSS\_PROCESSOR\_INFO** IOCTL is supported on Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012, and later versions of the operating system.

The **SIO\_QUERY\_RSS\_PROCESSOR\_INFO** IOCTL is used to determine the association between a socket and an RSS processor core and NUMA node.
This IOCTL returns a [**SOCKET\_PROCESSOR\_AFFINITY**](/windows/desktop/api/Ws2def/ns-ws2def-socket_processor_affinity) structure that contains the [**PROCESSOR\_NUMBER**](/windows/desktop/api/winnt/ns-winnt-processor_number) and the NUMA node ID.
The returned [**PROCESSOR\_NUMBER**](/windows/desktop/api/winnt/ns-winnt-processor_number) structure contains a group number and relative processor number within the group.

If the socket is a UDP socket, the socket must be connected for the **SIO\_QUERY\_RSS\_PROCESSOR\_INFO** IOCTL to work properly.
