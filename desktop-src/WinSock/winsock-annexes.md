# Winsock Annexes

Winsock Annexes provide implementation information for common Winsock protocol suites, and discuss how to use each protocol with Winsock.

Each protocol in this annex has conventions, behaviors, or special features that do not lend themselves to generic implementation. This section documents details that developers must consider when implementing or using the described protocols.

The Winsock Annexes include the following sections:

-   [Winsock ATM Annex](winsock-atm-annex.md)
-   [Winsock IPX/SPX Annex](winsock-ipx-spx-annex.md)
-   [Winsock TCP/IP Annex](winsock-tcp-ip-annex.md)
