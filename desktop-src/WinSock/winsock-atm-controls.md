# Winsock ATM Controls

ATM point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connection setup and teardown are natively supported by the Windows Sockets 2 specification. In fact, Windows Sockets 2 QoS specification and protocol-independent multipoint/multicast mechanisms were designed with ATM in mind, along with other protocols. See Section 2.7 and Appendix D of the Windows Sockets 2 API specification for Windows Sockets 2, Quality of Service, and Multipoint Support, respectively. Therefore, no ATM-specific Ioctls need to be introduced in this document.
