# gethostname Function in the SPI

The [**WSALookupServiceBegin**](wsalookupservicebegin-2.md) query uses SVCID\_HOSTNAME as the service class GUID. If *lpszServiceInstanceName* is null or references a null string (that is . ""), the local host is to be resolved. Otherwise, a lookup on a specified host name shall occur. For the purposes of emulating [**gethostname**](gethostname-2.md) the Ws2\_32.dll will specify a null pointer for *lpszServiceInstanceName*, and specify LUP\_RETURN\_NAME so that the host name is returned in the *lpszServiceInstanceName* parameter. If an application uses this query and specifies LUP\_RETURN\_ADDR then the host address will be provided in a **CSADDR\_INFO** structure. The LUP\_RETURN\_BLOB action is undefined for this query. Port information will be defaulted to zero unless the *lpszQueryString* references a service such as ftp, in which case the complete transport address of the indicated service will be supplied.
