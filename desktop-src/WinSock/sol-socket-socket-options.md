# SOL\_SOCKET Socket Options

The following tables describe **SOL\_SOCKET** socket options. See the [**getsockopt**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-getsockopt) and [**setsockopt**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-setsockopt) function reference pages for more information on getting and setting socket options.

To enumerate protocols and discover supported properties for each installed protocol, use the [**WSAEnumProtocols**](/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaenumprotocolsa), [**WSCEnumProtocols**](/windows/desktop/api/Ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wscenumprotocols), or [**WSCEnumProtocols32**](/windows/desktop/api/Ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wscenumprotocols32) function.

Some socket options require more explanation than these tables can convey; such options contain links to additional pages.

> [!Note]  
> All **SOL\_SOCKET** socket options apply equally to IPv4 and IPv6 (except SO\_BROADCAST, since broadcast is not implemented in IPv6).

## Remarks

The **SOL\_SOCKET** socket options are defined in several Winsock header files:

-   *Winsock2.h*
-   *Mswsock.h*
-   *Ws2def.h*

On the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows Vista and later, the organization of header files has changed and **SOL\_SOCKET** level is defined in the *Ws2def.h* header file which is automatically included in the *Winsock2.h* header file. Some of the **SOL\_SOCKET** socket options are defined in the *Winsock2.h* and *Mswsock.h* header files. The remaining **SOL\_SOCKET** socket options are defined in the *Ws2def.h* header file which is automatically included by the *Winsock2.h* header file. The *Ws2def.h* should never be used directly.

On the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP, the **SOL\_SOCKET** level is defined in the *Winsock2.h* header file. The **SOL\_SOCKET** socket options are defined in the *Winsock2.h* and *Mswsock.h* header files.
