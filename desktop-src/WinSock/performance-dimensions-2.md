# Performance Dimensions

Application performance differs according to perspective. For a user, an ideal application would deliver high performance and responsiveness. For an administrator, an ideal application would consume the least amount of network resources. Performance also differs based on application type. Performance for a bulk file transfer application might have different implications than performance for a transactional application.

The following sections address differing performance dimensions and application types, and how networking environments affects performance.

-   [Transactional versus Streaming Applications](transactional-versus-streaming-applications-2.md)
