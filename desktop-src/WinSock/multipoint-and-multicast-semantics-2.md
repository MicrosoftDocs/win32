# Multipoint and Multicast Semantics

In considering how to support multipoint and multicast semantics in Windows Sockets 2 (Winsock), a number of existing and proposed schemes (including IP-multicast, ATM point-to-multipoint connection, ST-II, T.120, H.320-MCU) were examined. To enable a coherent discussion of the various schemes, it is valuable to first create a taxonomy that characterizes the essential attributes of each. In this document, the term *multipoint* represents both multipoint and multicast.
