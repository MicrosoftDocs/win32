# Winsock ATM Function Details

Based on the taxonomy defined for Windows Sockets 2 protocol-independent multipoint/multicast schemes, ATM falls into the category of rooted data and rooted control planes. (See the Windows Sockets 2 API Specification, Appendix D for more information.) An application acting as the root would create c\_root sockets, and counterparts running on leaf nodes would utilize c\_leaf sockets. The root application will use [**WSAJoinLeaf**](/windows/win32/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsajoinleaf?branch=master) to add new leaf nodes. The corresponding applications on the leaf nodes will have set their c\_leaf sockets into the listening mode. **WSAJoinLeaf** with a c\_root socket specified will be mapped to the Q.2931 SETUP message (for the first leaf) or ADD PARTY message (for any subsequent leaves).

> [!Note]  
> The QoS parameters specified in **WSAJoinLeaf** for any subsequent leaves should be ignored per the ATM Forum UNI specification.

 

The leaf-initiated join is not part of the ATM UNI 3.1, but is supported in the ATM UNI 4.0. Thus [**WSAJoinLeaf**](/windows/win32/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsajoinleaf?branch=master) with a c\_leaf socket specified can be mapped to the appropriate ATM UNI 4.0 message.

The AAL Parameter and B-LLI negotiation is supported through the modification of the corresponding IEs in the *lpSQOS* parameter upon the invocation of the condition function specified in [**WSAAccept**](/windows/win32/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaaccept?branch=master).

> [!Note]  
> Only certain fields in those two IEs can be modified. See the ATM Forum UNI specification Appendix C and Appendix F for details.
