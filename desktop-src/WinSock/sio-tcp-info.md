# SIO_TCP_INFO Control Code

## Description

The **SIO\_TCP\_INFO** control code retrieves the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) statistics for a specified socket.

To perform this operation, call the [**WSAIoctl**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl) or **WSPIoctl** function with the following parameters.

```cpp
int WSAIoctl(
  (socket) s,             // descriptor identifying a socket
  SIO_TCP_INFO,                // dwIoControlCode
  (LPVOID) lpvInBuffer,   // pointer to a DWORD
  (DWORD) cbInBuffer,    // size, in bytes, of the input buffer
  (LPVOID) lpvOutBuffer,         // pointer to a TCP_INFO_v0 structure
  (DWORD) cbOutBuffer,       // size of the output buffer
  (LPDWORD) lpcbBytesReturned,    // number of bytes returned
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED) lpOverlapped,   // OVERLAPPED structure
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE) lpCompletionRoutine,  // completion routine
);
```

```cpp
int WSPIoctl(
  (socket) s,             // descriptor identifying a socket
  SIO_TCP_INFO,                // dwIoControlCode
  (LPVOID) lpvInBuffer,   // pointer to a DWORD
  (DWORD) cbInBuffer,           // size, in bytes, of the input buffer
  (LPVOID) lpvOutBuffer,         // pointer to a TCP_INFO_v0 structure
  (DWORD) cbOutBuffer,       // size of the output buffer
  (LPDWORD) lpcbBytesReturned,    // number of bytes returned
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED) lpOverlapped,   // OVERLAPPED structure
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE) lpCompletionRoutine,  // completion routine
  (LPWSATHREADID) lpThreadId,   // a WSATHREADID structure
  (LPINT) lpErrno   // a pointer to the error code.
);
```

## Parameters

### s

A descriptor that identifies a socket.

### dwIoControlCode

The control code for the operation.
Use **SIO\_TCP\_INFO** for this operation.

### lpvInBuffer

A pointer to the input buffer.
This parameter contains a pointer to a **DWORD** that specifies the version of the **SIO\_TCP\_INFO** control code that you are using. Specify 0 to use [TCP_INFO_v0](/windows/win32/api/mstcpip/ns-mstcpip-tcp_info_v0). Specify 1 to use [TCP_INFO_v1](/windows/win32/api/mstcpip/ns-mstcpip-tcp_info_v1), which provides more fields.

### cbInBuffer

The size, in bytes, of the input buffer.
This parameter should be the size of the **DWORD** data type.

### lpvOutBuffer

A pointer to the output buffer.
On successful output, this parameter contains a pointer to a [**TCP_INFO_v0**](/windows/desktop/api/mstcpip/ns-mstcpip-tcp_info_v0) structure that contains the TCP statistics for the specified socket.

### cbOutBuffer

The size, in bytes, of the output buffer.
This parameter must be at least the size of the [**TCP_INFO_v0**](/windows/desktop/api/mstcpip/ns-mstcpip-tcp_info_v0) structure.

### lpcbBytesReturned

A pointer to a variable that receives the size, in bytes, of the data stored in the output buffer.

If the output buffer is too small, the call fails, [**WSAGetLastError**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsagetlasterror) returns [**WSAEINVAL**](windows-sockets-error-codes-2.md), and the *lpcbBytesReturned* parameter points to a **DWORD** value of zero.

If *lpOverlapped* is **NULL**, the **DWORD** value pointed to by the *lpcbBytesReturned* parameter that is returned on a successful call cannot be zero.

If the *lpOverlapped* parameter is not **NULL** for overlapped sockets, operations that cannot be completed immediately will be initiated, and completion will be indicated at a later time.
The **DWORD** value pointed to by the *lpcbBytesReturned* parameter that is returned may be zero since the size of the data stored can't be determined until the overlapped operation has completed.
The final completion status can be retrieved when the appropriate completion method is signaled when the operation has completed.

### lpvOverlapped

A pointer to a [**WSAOVERLAPPED**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped) structure.

If socket *s* was created without the overlapped attribute, the *lpOverlapped* parameter is ignored.

If *s* was opened with the overlapped attribute and the *lpOverlapped* parameter is not **NULL**, the operation is performed as an overlapped (asynchronous) operation.
In this case, *lpOverlapped* parameter must point to a valid [**WSAOVERLAPPED**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped) structure.

For overlapped operations, the [**WSAIoctl**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl) or **WSPIoctl** function returns immediately, and the appropriate completion method is signaled when the operation has been completed.
Otherwise, the function does not return until the operation has been completed or an error occurs.

### lpCompletionRoutine

Type: \_In_opt\_ [**LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE**](/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nc-winsock2-lpwsaoverlapped_completion_routine)

A pointer to the completion routine called when the operation has been completed (ignored for non-overlapped sockets).

### lpThreadId

A pointer to a [**WSATHREADID**](/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/ns-ws2spi-wsathreadid) structure to be used by the provider in a subsequent call to [**WPUQueueApc**](/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wpuqueueapc).
The provider should store the referenced [**WSATHREADID**](/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/ns-ws2spi-wsathreadid) structure (not the pointer to same) until after the [**WPUQueueApc**](/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wpuqueueapc) function returns.

**Note**  This parameter applies only to the **WSPIoctl** function.

### lpErrno

A pointer to the error code.

**Note**  This parameter applies only to the **WSPIoctl** function.

## Return value

If the operation completes successfully, the [**WSAIoctl**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl) or **WSPIoctl** function returns zero.

If the operation fails or is pending, the [**WSAIoctl**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl) or **WSPIoctl** function returns **SOCKET\_ERROR**.
To get extended error information, call [**WSAGetLastError**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsagetlasterror).

| Error code | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| **WSAEMSGSIZE** | The pointer to the input buffer was **NULL**, or the specified size of the input buffer was not correct. |
| **WSAEINVAL** | An invalid argument was supplied. This error is returned if the *dwIoControlCode* parameter is not a valid command, or a specified input parameter is not acceptable, or the command is not applicable to the type of socket specified. |

## Remarks

Unlike retrieving TCP statistics with the [**GetPerTcpConnectionEStats**](/windows/desktop/api/iphlpapi/nf-iphlpapi-getpertcpconnectionestats) function, retrieving TCP statistics with this control code does not require the user code to load, store, and filter the TCP connection table, and does not require elevated privileges to use.
