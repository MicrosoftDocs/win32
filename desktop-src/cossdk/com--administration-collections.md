# COM+ Administration Collections

The COM+ administration collections serve to hold and organize configuration data stored in the COM+ catalog. The collections correspond to folders in the console tree of the Component Services administration tool. You can access these collections by using the COM+ administration objects and interfaces.

You initiate programmatic administration by using objects created from the [**COMAdminCatalog**](comadmincatalog.md) class, you represent any collections in the catalog by using objects created from the [**COMAdminCatalogCollection**](comadmincatalogcollection.md) class, and you represent items in collections by using objects created from the [**COMAdminCatalogObject**](comadmincatalogobject.md) class.

The items in a given collection expose a consistent set of properties. For example, every item in the [**Components**](components.md) collection represents a component, and the items in the **Components** collection expose the same properties used to configure a component. These properties can be accessed by using the [**COMAdminCatalogObject**](comadmincatalogobject.md) class.

> [!Note]  
> Properties with WriteOnce access are ReadWrite while using the [**Add**](/windows/desktop/api/ComAdmin/nf-comadmin-icatalogcollection-add) method prior to using [**SaveChanges**](/windows/desktop/api/ComAdmin/nf-comadmin-icatalogcollection-savechanges) and are ReadOnly afterward.

For an introduction to programmatic administration of COM+, see [Automating COM+ Administration](automating-com--administration.md).

## Collection Hierarchy

The following figure illustrates the relationships among the collections. The collections at the far left (in white and gray boxes) are top-level collections, which are accessed by calling the [**GetCollection**](/windows/desktop/api/ComAdmin/nf-comadmin-icomadmincatalog-getcollection) method of an object created from the [**COMAdminCatalog**](comadmincatalog.md) class. The remaining collections (in yellow boxes) can only be accessed through their parent collection, by calling the [**GetCollection**](/windows/desktop/api/ComAdmin/nf-comadmin-icatalogcollection-getcollection) method of the [**COMAdminCatalogCollection**](comadmincatalogcollection.md) object that represents their parent. The arrows point from a parent collection to its child collections.

![Diagram that shows the relationships among the collections.](images/ab61b0ab-2368-4bd8-9cfc-b7adc5beaca3.png)

The following four collections are not illustrated in the figure: [**ErrorInfo**](errorinfo.md), [**PropertyInfo**](propertyinfo.md), [**RelatedCollectionInfo**](relatedcollectioninfo.md), and [**Root**](root.md). The **ErrorInfo** collection is a child of every collection in the figure except [**InprocServers**](inprocservers.md) and [**WOWInprocServers**](wowinprocservers.md) (in gray boxes). The **PropertyInfo** and **RelatedCollectionInfo** collections are children of every collection. The **Root** collection is a top-level collection that is the parent of all other top-level collections. However, it is not necessary to access the **Root** collection before accessing other top-level collections.

## COMAdmin Library

The following collections are supported by the COMAdmin library.
