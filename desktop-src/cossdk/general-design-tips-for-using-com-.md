# General Design Tips for Using COM+

The key to good design is planning. If you are unfamiliar with designing a three-tier application, see the section entitled [Designing the COM+ Application Using UML](designing-the-com--application-using-uml.md).

How you construct the COM components that make up the middle tier of your COM+ application can dramatically affect performance, scalability, and ease of deployment. The following topics provide design considerations and implementation tips you should know about when designing COM components.

| [Designing for Scalability](designing-for-scalability.md)<br/>   | Suggests ways to increase the scalability of your COM+ application.<br/>                                             |
| [Designing for Availability](designing-for-availability.md)<br/> | Discusses services you can use to improve the availability your middle-tier functionality in COM+ applications.<br/> |
| [Designing for Security](designing-for-security.md)<br/>         | Discusses ways to most efficiently set up security for a COM+ application.<br/>                                      |
| [Designing for Deployment](designing-for-deployment.md)<br/>     | Discusses ways to minimize deployment headaches when designing a distributed application.<br/>                       |



 

Also, be sure to see [Improving Performance with Object Pooling](improving-performance-with-object-pooling.md) for ways to most effectively use object pooling.
