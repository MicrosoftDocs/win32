# COM+ SOAP Service

Simply by selecting the **Uses SOAP** check box in the Component Services administrative tool, you can expose a COM+ application as an XML web service. You can also transparently use an XML web service, whether deployed using COM+ or not, as a COM component. This means that you can easily create new XML web services out of existing COM+ applications and easily incorporate XML web services into new COM+ applications.

The topics described in the following table provide background and task information about using COM+ to expose your configured COM components as XML web services.
