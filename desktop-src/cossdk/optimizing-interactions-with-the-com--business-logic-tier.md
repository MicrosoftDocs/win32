# Optimizing Interactions with the COM+ Business Logic Tier

The architecture for a distributed application often breaks down the system into three (or more) tiers. Interactions between these tiers can dramatically affect the success of your application. This section discusses how to optimize the interactions between the business logic tier and the presentation and data tiers. See the following topics for more information:
