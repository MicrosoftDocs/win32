# Local Partitions

One way that partitions can be used is locally on an application server. In this scenario, an administrator can create a partition using the Component Services administrative tool. Partitions implemented locally and not within Active Directory are accessible to local users only, not to users on other computers in the domain. After a partition is created and a COM+ application is installed into it, the administrator can assign that partition as a default partition for one or more users on that server. To assign a default partition to a user, the administrator can use the Component Services administrative tool.
