# COM+ Low-Memory Activation Gates

The COM+ low-memory activation gates service automatically checks memory before a COM+ server or object is created. If the percentage of virtual memory available to the application falls below a fixed threshold, the activation fails before the object is created. In this way, the low-memory activation gates service greatly enhances system reliability.

The following topics provide background and task information about the COM+ low-memory activation gates service.
