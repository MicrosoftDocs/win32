# Designing COM+ Applications

Whether you are designing an application for conducting online commerce, tracking information, accessing data in legacy systems, messaging, resource planning, publishing and knowledge management, or a critical LOB (line of business) application, you can enhance and streamline your middle-tier design by integrating COM+ services. The most common way to do this is by grouping components into COM+ applications.

While a complete methodology review for using COM+ in all situations is beyond the scope of this document, the following topics present information you can use when creating a COM+ application.
