# Conversion of MTS Packages to COM+ Applications

COM+ can be viewed as a merging of Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) and COM, along with the introduction of new features.

For the most part, your MTS packages are converted to COM+ applications during the Windows setup procedure. Without doing anything beyond the typical setup, you can take advantage of all the new COM+ features. For a list and brief explanation of the most significant COM+ improvements, see [COM+ Programming Overview](com--programming-overview.md).

If you would like to learn more about the automatic conversion of MTS packages to COM+ applications during the Windows setup process, as well as how to troubleshoot any errors that might occur during this process, see [Automatic Conversion from MTS](automatic-conversion-from-mts.md).

If you would like to learn how to manually convert MTS packages to COM+ applications, see [Manual Conversion from MTS](manual-conversion-from-mts.md).

You should also be aware that installing COM+ introduces several new capabilities that your MTS packages may be able to use as COM+ applications. These are explained in [COM+ Conversion Results and Issues](com--conversion-results-and-issues.md).
