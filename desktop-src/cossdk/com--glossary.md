# COM+ Glossary

<dl> <dt>

<span id="cos.access_token_gloss"></span><span id="COS.ACCESS_TOKEN_GLOSS"></span>**access token**
</dt> <dd>

An object that describes the security context of a process or thread. The information in a token includes the identity and privileges of the user account associated with the process or thread. When a user logs on, the system verifies the user's password by comparing it with information stored in a security database. If the password is authenticated, the system produces an access token. Every process executed on behalf of this user has a copy of this access token.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="cos.acid_properties_gloss"></span><span id="COS.ACID_PROPERTIES_GLOSS"></span>**ACID properties**
</dt> <dd>

Acronym coined by transaction processing pioneers for atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable. These properties ensure predictable behavior, reinforcing the role of transactions as all-or-none propositions designed to provide consistent and predictable results in a distributed environment when independent failures can occur.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="cos.activation_gloss"></span><span id="COS.ACTIVATION_GLOSS"></span>**activation**
</dt> <dd>

The chain of events that results in the creation of a COM object and the return of a valid pointer to an interface on that object. In COM+, an object gets activated either in its own context or in that of its creator (an object that has requested the object being activated). COM+ services rely on appropriate activation of an object based on the object's configuration. In the course of activation, the system determines the context in which the object runs, initializes the context properties, checks access permissions, and establishes a security identity.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="cos.activation_security_gloss"></span><span id="COS.ACTIVATION_SECURITY_GLOSS"></span>**activation security**
</dt> <dd>

A form of security protection that determines who can launch a server. Activation security is automatically applied by the Service Control Manager (SCM) of a particular computer. Upon receipt of a request from a client to activate an object, the SCM checks the request against activation-security information stored within its registry. Activation security is also checked for same-computer activations. Also called *launch security*.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="cos.activation_type_gloss"></span><span id="COS.ACTIVATION_TYPE_GLOSS"></span>**activation type**
</dt> <dd>

Activation category for a COM+ application that indicates whether the application runs in or out of its client's process space (depending on whether it's a library or server application, respectively) as well as whether the application runs as a service.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="cos.activity_gloss"></span><span id="COS.ACTIVITY_GLOSS"></span>**activity**
</dt> <dd>

In COM+, a logical thread comprising one or more transactions and containing a collection of components that are grouped into a COM+ application. Every COM object belongs to one activity. The association between an object and an activity cannot be changed.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="cos.apartment_model_process_gloss"></span><span id="COS.APARTMENT_MODEL_PROCESS_GLOSS"></span>**apartment model process**

<span id="cos.application_proxy_gloss"></span><span id="COS.APPLICATION_PROXY_GLOSS"></span>**application proxy**
</dt> <dd>

A set of files containing registration information that allows a client to remotely access a COM+ server application. When installed on a client computer, an application proxy file writes information about the server application to the client computer; the client can then remotely access the server application.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="cos.authentication_gloss"></span><span id="COS.AUTHENTICATION_GLOSS"></span>**authentication**
</dt> <dd>

The security process of determining that a caller of an application is actually who it says it isâ€”verifying the authenticity of an identity claim. For COM+ applications, authentication can be turned on and configured administratively, after which it works transparently to the application.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="cos.authorization_gloss"></span><span id="COS.AUTHORIZATION_GLOSS"></span>**authorization**
</dt> <dd>

The security process of determining whether a caller of an application is authorized to do what it is asking to do.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="cos.caching_resource_manager_gloss"></span><span id="COS.CACHING_RESOURCE_MANAGER_GLOSS"></span>**caching resource manager**
</dt> <dd>

A resource manager that acts as a front-end to another resource manager and that caches information locally, reducing the cost of accessing the underlying resource. Unlike a conventional resource manager, a caching resource manager does not participate in recovery because it never permanently stores the underlying data.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="cos.call_security_gloss"></span><span id="COS.CALL_SECURITY_GLOSS"></span>**call security**

</dt> <dd>

In the COM programming model, a programming structure encapsulating both data and functionality, which are defined and allocated as a single unit and for which the only public access is through the programming structure's interfaces. A COM object must support, at a minimum, the [**IUnknown**](/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown) interface, which maintains the object's existence while it is being used and provides access to the object's other interfaces.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="cos.compensating_resource_manager_gloss"></span><span id="COS.COMPENSATING_RESOURCE_MANAGER_GLOSS"></span>**Compensating Resource Manager (CRM)**
</dt> <dd>

A COM+ feature that enables non-transactional resources to participate in a two-phase commit transaction with the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC). Typically, CRMs do not provide the isolation capabilities of full resource managers, but they do provide transactional atomicity and durability by writing to a log.

</dd> <dt>

</dd> <dt>

<span id="cos.dynamic_cloaking_gloss"></span><span id="COS.DYNAMIC_CLOAKING_GLOSS"></span>**dynamic cloaking**
</dt> <dd>

A form of cloaking where the original client identity is discovered as the server thread access token on each method call to the downstream server. Although the identity that is presented can be determined dynamically, the overhead required to do this can be considerably more expensive. For COM+ applications, the default configuration is for dynamic cloaking capability because it provides the flexibility that is usually required by circumstances that necessitate using impersonation in the first place.

</dt> <dd>

An automatic service provided by COM+ that allows idle server resources to be used more productively. When a component is configured as JIT activated, COM+ can deactivate an instance of it while a client still holds an active reference to the object. The next time the client calls a method on the object, COM+ will reactivate the object transparently to the client, just in time.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="cos.legacy_component_gloss"></span><span id="COS.LEGACY_COMPONENT_GLOSS"></span>**legacy component**

</dt> <dd>

An event whose sender (publisher) and receiver (subscriber) are not closely bound. In a loosely coupled event system, such as COM+ Events, event information from different publishers is persisted in an event store. Subscribers query this store and select the events that they want to receive. Selecting event information from the event store creates a subscription. When an event occurs, the event system looks in this database and finds the interested subscribers, creates a new object of each interested class, and calls a method on that object.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="cos.marshaling_gloss"></span><span id="COS.MARSHALING_GLOSS"></span>**marshaling**

</dt> <dd>

In the three-tier architecture model for business applications, the layer comprising the business logic and data rules. The components that make up the middle tier can be used to enforce business rules, such as business algorithms, legal or governmental regulations, and data rules, which are designed to keep the data structures consistent within either specific or multiple databases. Because these middle-tier components are not tied to a specific client, they can be used by all applications and can be moved to different locations as response time and other rules require. Also called *business services layer* or *business logic tier*.

</dt> <dd>

An apartment model in which all the threads in the process that have been initialized as free-threaded reside in a single apartment. Therefore, there is no need to marshal between threads. The threads need not retrieve and dispatch messages because COM does not use window messages in this model.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="cos.nested_transaction_gloss"></span><span id="COS.NESTED_TRANSACTION_GLOSS"></span>**nested transaction**
</dt> <dd>

A secondary transaction initiated from within an existing primary or parent transaction boundary. The primary transaction does not commit until all of its subordinate, or nested, transactions commit. COM+ does not support nested transactions.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="cos.physical_model_gloss"></span><span id="COS.PHYSICAL_MODEL_GLOSS"></span>**physical model**
</dt> <dd>

The third and final step in the COM+ application design process, where the developer determines where the components reside physically and how they are to be coded.

<span id="cos.player_gloss"></span><span id="COS.PLAYER_GLOSS"></span>**player**
</dt> <dd>

The architectural element of the COM+ Queued Components service that retrieves the message from a queue and then loads the server object and the standard interface stubs to unmarshal data and invoke server methods. The player unmarshals the client's security context at the server side and then invokes the server component and makes the same method calls. The method calls are not played back by the player until the client component completes and the transaction that recorded the method calls commits.
