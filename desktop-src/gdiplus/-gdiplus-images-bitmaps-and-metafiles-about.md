# Images, Bitmaps, and Metafiles

Windows GDI+ provides the [**Image**](/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusheaders/nl-gdiplusheaders-image) class for working with raster images (bitmaps) and vector images (metafiles). The [**Bitmap**](/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusheaders/nl-gdiplusheaders-bitmap) class and the [**Metafile**](/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusheaders/nl-gdiplusheaders-metafile) class both inherit from the **Image** class. The **Bitmap** class expands on the capabilities of the **Image** class by providing additional methods for loading, saving, and manipulating raster images. The **Metafile** class expands on the capabilities of the **Image** class by providing additional methods for recording and examining vector images.
