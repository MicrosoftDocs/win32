# Constructing and Drawing Paths

A path is a sequence of graphics primitives (lines, rectangles, curves, text, and the like) that can be manipulated and drawn as a single unit. A path can be divided into *figures* that are either open or closed. A figure can contain several primitives.

You can draw a path by calling the [**Graphics::DrawPath**](/windows/desktop/api/Gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-drawpath) method of the [**Graphics**](/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusgraphics/nl-gdiplusgraphics-graphics) class, and you can fill a path by calling the [**Graphics::FillPath**](/windows/desktop/api/Gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-fillpath) method of the **Graphics** class.

The following topics cover paths in more detail:

-   [Creating Figures from Lines, Curves, and Shapes](-gdiplus-creating-figures-from-lines-curves-and-shapes-use.md)
-   [Filling Open Figures](-gdiplus-filling-open-figures-use.md)
