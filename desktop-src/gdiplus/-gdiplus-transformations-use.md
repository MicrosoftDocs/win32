# Transformations

Affine transformations include rotating, scaling, reflecting, shearing, and translating. In Windows GDI+, the [**Matrix**](/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusmatrix/nl-gdiplusmatrix-matrix) class provides the foundation for performing affine transformations on vector drawings, images, and text.

The following topics cover transformations in more detail:
