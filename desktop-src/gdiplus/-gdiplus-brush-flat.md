# Brush Functions (GDI+)

Windows GDI+ exposes a flat API that consists of about 600 functions, which are implemented in Gdiplus.dll and declared in Gdiplusflat.h. The functions in the GDI+ flat API are wrapped by a collection of about 40 C++ classes. It is recommended that you do not directly call the functions in the flat API. Whenever you make calls to GDI+, you should do so by calling the methods and functions provided by the C++ wrappers. Microsoft Product Support Services will not provide support for code that calls the flat API directly. For more information on using these wrapper methods, see [GDI+ Flat API](-gdiplus-flatapi-flat.md).

The following flat API functions are wrapped by the [**Brush**](/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusbrush/nl-gdiplusbrush-brush) C++ class.
