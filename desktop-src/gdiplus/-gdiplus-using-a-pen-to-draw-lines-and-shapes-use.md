# Using a Pen to Draw Lines and Shapes

The [**Graphics**](/windows/win32/api/gdiplusgraphics/nl-gdiplusgraphics-graphics) class provides a variety of drawing methods including those shown in the following list:

-   [DrawLine Methods](/windows/win32/api/gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-drawline(inconstpen_inint_inint_inint_inint))
-   [DrawRectangle Methods](/windows/win32/api/gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-drawrectangle(inconstpen_inconstrectf_))
-   [DrawEllipse Methods](/windows/win32/api/gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-drawellipse(inconstpen_inconstrectf_))
-   [DrawArc Methods](/windows/win32/api/gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-drawarc(inconstpen_inconstrectf__inreal_inreal))
-   [**Graphics::DrawPath**](/windows/win32/api/Gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-drawpath)
-   [DrawCurve Methods](/windows/win32/api/gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-drawcurve(inconstpen_inconstpoint_inint))
-   [DrawBezier Methods](/windows/win32/api/gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-drawbezier(inconstpen_inconstpointf__inconstpointf__inconstpointf__inconstpointf_))

One of the arguments that you pass to such a drawing method is the address of a [**Pen**](/windows/win32/api/gdipluspen/nl-gdipluspen-pen) object.
