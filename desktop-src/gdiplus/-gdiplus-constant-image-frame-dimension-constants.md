# Image Frame Dimension Constants

The Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) image file formats enable you to store multiple frames in a single image file. Multiple frames in a GIF file are used for animation, so the frames are said to be in the time dimension. Multiple frames in a TIFF file are typically used as separate pages, so the frames are said to be in the page dimension.

The following constants, defined in Gdiplusimaging.h, represent GUIDs that identify the page and time dimensions.

-   FrameDimensionPage
-   FrameDimensionTime
