# Security Considerations: GDI+

This topic provides information about security considerations related to programming with Windows GDI+. This topic doesn't provide all you need to know about security issuesâ€”instead, use it as a starting point and reference for this technology area.

## Verifying the Success of Constructors

Many of the GDI+ classes provide a [**Image::GetLastStatus**](/windows/desktop/api/Gdiplusheaders/nf-gdiplusheaders-image-getlaststatus) method that you can call to determine whether methods invoked on an object are successful. You can also call **Image::GetLastStatus** to determine whether a constructor is successful.

The following example shows how to construct an [**Image**](/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusheaders/nl-gdiplusheaders-image) object and call the [**Image::GetLastStatus**](/windows/desktop/api/Gdiplusheaders/nf-gdiplusheaders-image-getlaststatus) method to determine whether the constructor was successful. The values **Ok** and **InvalidParameter** are elements of the [**Status**](/windows/desktop/api/Gdiplustypes/ne-gdiplustypes-status) enumeration.


```C++
Image myImage(L"Climber.jpg");
Status st = myImage.GetLastStatus();

if(Ok == st)
   // The constructor was successful. Use myImage.
else if(InvalidParameter == st)
   // The constructor failed because of an invalid parameter.
else
   // Compare st to other elements of the Status 
   // enumeration or do general error processing.
```



## Allocating Buffers

Several GDI+ methods return numeric or character data in a buffer that is allocated by the caller. For each of those methods, there is a companion method that gives the size of the required buffer. For example, the [**GraphicsPath::GetPathPoints**](/windows/win32/api/gdipluspath/nf-gdipluspath-graphicspath-getpathpoints(outpoint_inint)) method returns an array of [**Point**](/windows/desktop/api/gdiplustypes/nl-gdiplustypes-point) objects. Before you call **GraphicsPath::GetPathPoints**, you must allocate a buffer large enough to hold that array. You can determine the size of the required buffer by calling the [**GraphicsPath::GetPointCount**](/windows/desktop/api/Gdipluspath/nf-gdipluspath-graphicspath-getpointcount) method of a [**GraphicsPath**](/windows/desktop/api/gdipluspath/nl-gdipluspath-graphicspath) object.

The following example shows how to determine the number of points in a [**GraphicsPath**](/windows/desktop/api/gdipluspath/nl-gdipluspath-graphicspath) object, allocate a buffer large enough to hold that many points, and then call [**GraphicsPath::GetPathPoints**](/windows/win32/api/gdipluspath/nf-gdipluspath-graphicspath-getpathpoints(outpoint_inint)) to fill the buffer. Before the code calls **GraphicsPath::GetPathPoints**, it verifies that the buffer allocation was successful by making sure that the buffer pointer is not **NULL**.


```C++
GraphicsPath path;
path.AddEllipse(10, 10, 200, 100);

INT count = path.GetPointCount();          // get the size
Point* pointArray = new Point[count];      // allocate the buffer

if(pointArray)  // Check for successful allocation.
{
   path.GetPathPoints(pointArray, count);  // get the data
   ...                                     // use pointArray
   delete[] pointArray;                    // release the buffer
   pointArray = NULL;
}
```



The previous example uses the new operator to allocate a buffer. The new operator was convenient because the buffer was filled with a known number of [**Point**](/windows/desktop/api/gdiplustypes/nl-gdiplustypes-point) objects. In some cases, GDI+ writes more into buffer than an array of GDI+ objects. Sometimes a buffer is filled with an array of GDI+ objects along with additional data that is pointed to by members of those objects. For example, the [**Image::GetAllPropertyItems**](/windows/desktop/api/Gdiplusheaders/nf-gdiplusheaders-image-getallpropertyitems) method returns an array of [**PropertyItem**](/windows/win32/api/gdiplusimaging/nl-gdiplusimaging-propertyitem) objects, one for each property item (piece of metadata) stored in the image. But **Image::GetAllPropertyItems** returns more than just the array of **PropertyItem** objects; it appends the array with additional data.

Before you call [**Image::GetAllPropertyItems**](/windows/desktop/api/Gdiplusheaders/nf-gdiplusheaders-image-getallpropertyitems), you must allocate a buffer large enough to hold the array of [**PropertyItem**](/windows/win32/api/gdiplusimaging/nl-gdiplusimaging-propertyitem) objects along with the additional data. You can call the [**Image::GetPropertySize**](/windows/desktop/api/Gdiplusheaders/nf-gdiplusheaders-image-getpropertysize) method of an Image object to determine the total size of the required buffer.

The following example shows how to create an [**Image**](/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusheaders/nl-gdiplusheaders-image) object and later call the [**Image::GetAllPropertyItems**](/windows/desktop/api/Gdiplusheaders/nf-gdiplusheaders-image-getallpropertyitems) method of that **Image** object to retrieve all the property items (metadata) stored in the image. The code allocates a buffer based on a size value returned by the [**Image::GetPropertySize**](/windows/desktop/api/Gdiplusheaders/nf-gdiplusheaders-image-getpropertysize) method. **Image::GetPropertySize** also returns a count value that gives the number of property items in the image. Notice that the code does not calculate the buffer size as `count*sizeof(PropertyItem)`. A buffer calculated that way would be too small.


```C++
UINT count = 0;
UINT size = 0;
Image myImage(L"FakePhoto.jpg");
myImage.GetPropertySize(&size, &count);

// GetAllPropertyItems returns an array of PropertyItem objects
// along with additional data. Allocate a buffer large enough to 
// receive the array and the additional data.
PropertyItem* propBuffer =(PropertyItem*)malloc(size);

if(propBuffer)
{
   myImage.GetAllPropertyItems(size, count, propBuffer);
   ...
   free(propBuffer);
   propBuffer = NULL;
}
```



## Error Checking

Most of the code examples in the GDI+ documentation do not show error checking. Complete error checking makes a code example much longer and can obscure the point being illustrated by the example. You should not paste examples from the documentation directly into production code; rather, you should enhance the examples by adding your own error checking.

The following example shows one way of implementing error checking with GDI+. Each time a GDI+ object is constructed, the code checks to see whether the constructor was successful. That check is especially important for the [**Image**](/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusheaders/nl-gdiplusheaders-image) constructor, which relies on reading a file. If all four of the GDI+ objects ([**Graphics**](/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusgraphics/nl-gdiplusgraphics-graphics), [**GraphicsPath**](/windows/desktop/api/gdipluspath/nl-gdipluspath-graphicspath), **Image**, and [**TextureBrush**](/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusbrush/nl-gdiplusbrush-texturebrush)) are constructed successfully, the code calls methods on those objects. Each method call is checked for success, and in the event of failure, the remaining method calls are skipped.


```C++
Status GdipExample(HDC hdc)
{
   Status status = GenericError;
   INT count = 0;
   Point* points = NULL;

   Graphics graphics(hdc);
   status = graphics.GetLastStatus();
   if(Ok != status)
      return status;

   GraphicsPath path;
   status = path.GetLastStatus();
   if(Ok != status)
      return status;

   Image image(L"MyTexture.bmp");
   status = image.GetLastStatus();
   if(Ok != status)
      return status;

   TextureBrush brush(&image);
   status = brush.GetLastStatus();
   if(Ok != status)
      return status;

   status = path.AddEllipse(10, 10, 200, 100);

   if(Ok == status)
   {
      status = path.AddBezier(40, 130, 200, 130, 200, 200, 60, 200);
   }
  
   if(Ok == status)
   {
      count = path.GetPointCount();
      status = path.GetLastStatus();
   }

   if(Ok == status)
   {
      points = new Point[count];

      if(NULL == points)
         status = OutOfMemory;
   }

   if(Ok == status)
   {
      status = path.GetPathPoints(points, count);  
   }
  
   if(Ok == status)
   {
      status = graphics.FillPath(&brush, &path);
   }
   
   if(Ok == status)
   {
      for(int j = 0; j < count; ++j)
      {
         status = graphics.FillEllipse(
         &brush, points[j].X - 5, points[j].Y - 5, 10, 10);
      }
   }

   if(points)
   {
      delete[] points;
      points = NULL;
   }

   return status;
}
```



## Thread Synchronization

It is possible for more than one thread to have access to a single GDI+ object. However, GDI+ does not provide any automatic synchronization mechanism. So if two threads in your application have a pointer to the same GDI+ object, it is your responsibility to synchronize access to that object.

Some GDI+ methods return **ObjectBusy** if a thread attempts to call a method while another thread is executing a method on the same object. Do not try to synchronize access to an object based on the **ObjectBusy** return value. Instead, each time you access a member or call a method of the object, place the call inside a critical section, or use some other standard synchronization technique.
