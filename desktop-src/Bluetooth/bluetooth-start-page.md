# Bluetooth

## Purpose

Bluetooth is an industry-standard protocol that enables wireless connectivity for computers, handheld devices, mobile phones, and other devices.

## Where applicable

The Bluetooth application programming interface enables developers to use existing network programming knowledge to quickly develop or port applications.

## Developer audience

Bluetooth is designed for use by C/C++ programmers. Some Bluetooth features are available with Windows Sockets. Familiarity with Microsoft Windows networking and Windows Sockets programming is required.

## Run-time requirements

Microsoft Bluetooth support begins with Windows XP with Service Pack 1 (SP1).

Support for Bluetooth 2.1 is offered in Windows Vista SP2 and Windows 7.
