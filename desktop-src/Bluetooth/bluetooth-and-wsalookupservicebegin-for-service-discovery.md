# Bluetooth and WSALookupServiceBegin for Service Discovery

To discover the existence of a particular service on a Bluetooth server, clients use the [**WSALookupServiceBegin**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicebegina), [**WSALookupServiceNext**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicenexta), and [**WSALookupServiceEnd**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupserviceend) functions. Queries can be performed for local and remote addresses, but connections can only be established with remote addresses. Service handles discovered during this operation cannot be used to delete the service via [**WSASetService**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsasetservicea). Loopback is not supported by RFCOMM.

Two basic types of service discovery queries can be performed:

-   Queries for one or more services on the local device
-   Queries for one or more services on a specified peer device

The [**WSALookupServiceBegin**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicebegina) function receives a [**WSAQUERYSET**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaquerysetw) structure in its *lpqsRestrictions* parameter. **WSALookupServiceBegin** performs a client query based on the set of search restrictions that the **WSAQUERYSET** contains. Bluetooth clients must specify the restrictions, listed in the following table, in the **WSAQUERYSET** structure when using the **WSALookupServiceBegin** function to query for services.



| WSAQUERYSET member    | Restriction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **dwSize**            | Set to **sizeof**([**WSAQUERYSET**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaquerysetw)).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **lpServiceClassId**  | Set to the most specific Bluetooth UUID that can be used to determine the scope of the query. For example, setting **lpServiceClassId** to the UUID of the L2CAP protocol results in all L2CAP services returned, essentially enumerating all SD records on the target. Setting the UUID to a specific service, however, returns only the instances of that service.<br/> |
| **dwNameSpace**       | Set to **NS\_BTH**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **dwNumberOfCsAddrs** | Set to 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **lpszContext**       | Set to the Bluetooth Device Address with which to establish an SDP connection to perform the query of services. This member must be a string that is converted by using the [**WSAAddressToString**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaaddresstostringa) function. If the local radio address is supplied, the local SDP records are searched.<br/>                                             |
| Other members         | All other members of the [**WSAQUERYSET**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaquerysetw) structure are ignored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |



 

The SDP connection to the remote device does not remain active after the [**WSALookupServiceBegin**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicebegina) function completes a service query; the connection is terminated before **WSALookupServiceBegin** returns. Applications that require the SDP connection to remain active after a service query completes should specify the service class UUID to which to connect by using the **serviceClassId** member of the [**SOCKADDR\_BTH**](/windows/desktop/api/Ws2bth/ns-ws2bth-sockaddr_bth) structure when issuing the Windows Sockets [**connect**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-connect) function call.

The flags, listed in the following table, are used in the *dwControlFlags* parameter of the [**WSALookupServiceBegin**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicebegina) and [**WSALookupServiceNext**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicenexta) functions to control the query results. The **LUP\_CONTAINERS** and **LUP\_FLUSHCACHE** flags are used by the **WSALookupServiceBegin** function; the rest of the flags are used in calls to the **WSALookupServiceNext** function.


| Flag | Result | 
|------|--------|
| <strong>LUP_CONTAINERS</strong> | Must not be set. | 
| <strong>LUP_FLUSHCACHE</strong> | Applications should generally specify <strong>LUP_FLUSHCACHE</strong>. This flag instructs the system to ignore any cached information and establish an over-the-air SDP connection to the specified device to perform the SDP search. This non-cached operation may take several seconds (whereas a cached search returns quickly). Bluetooth currently does not proactively cache SDP records from nearby devices, nor does it currently aggressively cache previous queries. Therefore, applications should anticipate that queries may return no results (with an error code of <strong>WSASERVICE_NOT_FOUND</strong>) if <strong>LUP_FLUSHCACHE</strong> is not specified. The cached data that is available by using the Windows Sockets interface may be enhanced in the future. | 
| <strong>LUP_RES_SERVICE</strong> | Return information about the local Bluetooth address. This flag has an effect only if <strong>LUP_RETURN_ADDR</strong> is also specified. | 
| <strong>LUP_RETURN_NAME</strong> | Return the display name of the service in the <strong>lpszServiceInstanceName</strong> member of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaquerysetw"><strong>WSAQUERYSET</strong></a> structure for each call to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicenexta"><strong>WSALookupServiceNext</strong></a> function. | 
| **LUP_RETURN_TYPE** | Return the service class ID in the **lpServiceClassId** member of the [**WSAQUERYSET**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaquerysetw) structure. **Note:** Use of this flag is only applicable to the [**WSALookupServiceBegin**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicebegina) function. This value is always zero for [**WSALookupServiceNext**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicenexta).<br> | 
| <strong>LUP_RETURN_ADDR</strong> | Return an address in the <strong>lpcsaBuffer</strong> member to be used with <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-connect"><strong>connect</strong></a> function calls. The returned address contains the port number. | 
| <strong>LUP_RETURN_BLOB</strong> | Return the matching SD records in the <strong>lpBlob</strong> member, formatted according to the Bluetooth SDP record specification. | 
| <strong>LUP_RETURN_ALL</strong> | Return all of the above flags' information. | 
| <strong>LUP_RETURN_COMMENT</strong> | Return the service description in the <strong>lpszComment</strong> member of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaquerysetw"><strong>WSAQUERYSET</strong></a> structure for each call to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicenexta"><strong>WSALookupServiceNext</strong></a> function. | 
| <strong>LUP_FLUSHPREVIOUS</strong> | Skip the next available record, and return the record that follows it. | 




 

## Advanced Service Queries

The query operations that are described in the previous section can be used to return all results from a single GUID, which should be sufficient for most applications. An advanced query enables an application to create a more specific query; it provides the capability to match UUIDs and attributes in returned information.

To perform an advanced query for services, Bluetooth clients must specify the following restrictions in the [**WSAQUERYSET**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaquerysetw) structure that is passed into the *lpqsRestrictions* parameter.



| WSAQUERYSET member   | Restriction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **SDP\_SERVICE\_SEARCH\_REQUEST**                                                    | An array of SDP record handles that is identical to the **ServiceRecordHandleList** defined by Bluetooth 1.1 SDP 4.5.2. The number of SDP handles that is returned is calculated by (**lpBlob**->cbSize)/**sizeof**(ULONG). All results are returned in a single call to the [**WSALookupServiceNext**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicenexta) function. |
| **SDP\_SERVICE\_ATTRIBUTE\_REQUEST** or **SDP\_SERVICE\_SEARCH\_ATTRIBUTE\_REQUEST** | A binary Bluetooth SDP record. For **SDP\_SERVICE\_ATTRIBUTE\_REQUEST**, all results are returned in a single call to the [**WSALookupServiceNext**](/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicenexta) function.                                                                                                                                                       |



 

> [!Note]  
> If the **lpBlob** member is not specified during input for a service query, a service and attribute search is performed for the service specified in the **lpServiceClassId** member on attributes from 0 through 0xFFFF.
