# Managing Bluetooth Devices and Services

This section describes how to use the Bluetooth API to directly control Bluetooth devices and services.

For information about using the Windows Sockets interface to program Bluetooth on Windows, see [Windows Sockets Support for Bluetooth](windows-sockets-support-for-bluetooth.md).

> [!Note]  
> Bluetooth does not prevent power management features from interrupting Bluetooth transmissions. Bluetooth-enabled applications can monitor power messages to prevent such interruption. For more information, see [Using Power Management](/windows/desktop/Power/using-power-management).
