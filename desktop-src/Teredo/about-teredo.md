# About Teredo

Due to the limited number of available IPv4 addresses, Internet Service Providers (ISP) will need to begin the transition to IPv6. Windows Vista will provide full support for IPv6, allowing developers to ensure their applications are ready for tomorrow by enabling IPv6 support today. With Teredo, Windows Vista desktops are capable of IPv6 connectivity even if ISP networks are IPv4 only.

Technologies like Peer-to-Peer require end-to-end connectivity for the complete user experience. Many homes have Network Address Translation (NAT) devices that limit these technologies and application developers have to focus on finding efficient ways to work around these issues. However, Teredo support with Windows Vista reduces the burden on the application developers by providing seamless NAT traversal.

This section of the documentation contains information about the Teredo interface, and includes the following topics:
