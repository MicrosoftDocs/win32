# Using Teredo

When developing an application that uses [Teredo](about-teredo.md), the goal is to achieve IPv6 connectivity and not focus on using Teredo. For example, Windows Meeting Space and Remote Assistance are two applications that take advantage of end-to-end connectivity provided by IPv6. These applications can obtain connectivity using native IPv6, 6to4 or Teredo addresses. For these applications and any others that may be developed for IPv6, Teredo is handled like any other protocol that enables connectivity.

The following topics outline standard usage scenarios that occur when using the Teredo interface:

-   [Implementing Teredo](implementing-teredo.md)
-   [Implementing the Teredo Security Model](implementing-the-teredo-security-model.md)
-   [Receiving Solicited Traffic Over Teredo](receiving-solicited-traffic-over-teredo.md)
-   [Receiving Unsolicited Traffic Over Teredo](receiving-unsolicited-traffic-over-teredo.md)
-   [Using Teredo with IP Helper](using-teredo-with-ip-helper.md)
