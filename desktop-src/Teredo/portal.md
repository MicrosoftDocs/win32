# Teredo

## Purpose

Teredo is an IPv6 transition technology that provides address assignment and host-to-host automatic tunneling for unicast IPv6 traffic when IPv6/IPv4 hosts are located behind one or multiple IPv4 network address translators (NATs). To traverse IPv4 NATs, IPv6 packets are sent as IPv4 User Datagram Protocol (UDP) messages.

## Developer audience

Teredo is designed for use by C/C++ developers with IPv6 network programming experience.

## Run-time requirements

The Teredo interface is primarily supported by Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. The limited functionality of the Teredo Interface supported by Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2) and Windows Server 2003 is detailed in [Receiving Solicited Traffic Over Teredo](receiving-solicited-traffic-over-teredo.md).
