# Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI)

## Purpose

The Windows Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) is a versatile interface standard that allows your applications and services to integrate with any antimalware product that's present on a machine. AMSI provides enhanced malware protection for your end-users and their data, applications, and workloads.

AMSI is agnostic of antimalware vendor; it's designed to allow for the most common malware scanning and protection techniques provided by today's antimalware products that can be integrated into applications. It supports a calling structure allowing for file and memory or stream scanning, content source URL/IP reputation checks, and other techniques.

AMSI also supports the notion of a session so that antimalware vendors can correlate different scan requests. For instance, the different fragments of a malicious payload can be associated to reach a more informed decision, which would be much harder to reach just by looking at those fragments in isolation.

## Windows components that integrate with AMSI

The AMSI feature is integrated into these components of Windows 10.

- User Account Control, or UAC (elevation of EXE, COM, MSI, or ActiveX installation)
- PowerShell (scripts, interactive use, and dynamic code evaluation)
- Windows Script Host (wscript.exe and cscript.exe)
- JavaScript and VBScript
- Office VBA macros

## Developer audience, and sample code

The Antimalware Scan Interface is designed for use by two groups of developers.

- Application developers who want to make requests to antimalware products from within their apps.
- Third-party creators of antimalware products who want their products to offer the best features to applications.

For more info, see [Developer audience, and sample code](dev-audience.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Starting in Windows 10, version 1903, if your AMSI provider DLL is not Authenticode-signed, then it may not be loaded (depending on how the host machine is configured). For full details, see [**IAntimalwareProvider** interface](/windows/desktop/api/amsi/nn-amsi-iantimalwareprovider).
