# Using Pipes

The following examples demonstrate the use of pipes to pass a continuous stream of data between processes:

-   [Multithreaded pipe server](multithreaded-pipe-server.md)
-   [Named pipe server using overlapped I/O](named-pipe-server-using-overlapped-i-o.md)
-   [Named pipe server using completion routines](named-pipe-server-using-completion-routines.md)
-   [Named pipe client](named-pipe-client.md)
-   [Transactions on named pipes](transactions-on-named-pipes.md)
