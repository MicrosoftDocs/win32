# About Pipes

There are two types of pipes: [anonymous pipes](anonymous-pipes.md) and [named pipes](named-pipes.md). Anonymous pipes require less overhead than named pipes, but offer limited services.

The term pipe, as used here, implies that a pipe is used as an information conduit. Conceptually, a pipe has two ends. A one-way pipe allows the process at one end to write to the pipe, and allows the process at the other end to read from the pipe. A two-way (or duplex) pipe allows a process to read and write from its end of the pipe.
