# W3C Logging

W3C extended logging is type of server side logging that can be enabled on the server session or URL group. When W3C logging is enabled on a URL group, logging is performed only on requests that are routed to the URL Group. A separate log file is created for each URL group configured to enable W3C logging.

When W3C logging is enabled on the server session it functions as centralized form of logging for all the URL groups under the server session. A single log file is maintained for all of the URL groups in the server session.

The following table lists the fields that can be logged by the HTTP Server API. The table contains a subset of the [**HTTP\_LOG\_FIELD**](http-log-field--constants.md) constants. Some of the fields listed below are auto generated by HTTP Server API internally and therefore not contained in the [**HTTP\_LOG\_FIELDS\_DATA**](/windows/desktop/api/Http/ns-http-http_log_fields_data) structure. The "Appears As" column contains the text that appears in the log file. The data in the table is in the order of occurrence in the log file record.

Fields that are not marked "HTTP Server API generated" have to be passed inside [**HTTP\_LOG\_FIELDS\_DATA**](/windows/desktop/api/Http/ns-http-http_log_fields_data) structure by application. Application could generate those fields from the [**HTTP\_REQUEST**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa364545(v=vs.85)) structure passed to it.

The log file is a customizable ASCII text-based format. The field prefixes in the file are defined as follows:

| Prefix    | Description                          |
|-----|---------------------------|
| s   | Server actions.           |
| c   | Client actions.           |
| sc  | Server-to-Client actions. |
| cs  | Client-to-Server actions. |



 

The application can select one or more of the W3C Extended log file fields, however, not all fields will contain information. For fields that are selected but for which there is no information, a hyphen (-) appears as a placeholder. If a field contains a nonprintable character, the HTTP Server API replaces it with a plus sign (+) to preserve the log file format. This typically occurs with virus attacks, when, for example, a malicious user sends carriage returns and line feeds that, if not replaced with the plus sign (+), would break the log file format. Fields are separated by spaces.

If a field is enabled by the URL group or server session, but not selected for the request, it appears in the log file with a hyphen (-) as a placeholder.

Log files are created when the first request arrives on the URL Group or server session, they are not created when logging is configured. The following example shows the first log file entry for a W3C log file with the Client IP, Username, Server IP, Server Port, Method, URI Stem, URI Query, Status, and User Agent fields enabled:

``` syntax
#Software: Microsoft HTTP Server API 2.0  
#Version: 1.0   // the log file version as it's described by "https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-logfile".
#Date: 2002-05-02 17:42:15  // when the first log file entry was recorded, which is when the entire log file was created.
#Fields: date time c-ip cs-username s-ip s-port cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query sc-status cs(User-Agent)
2002-05-02 17:42:15 172.22.255.255 - 172.30.255.255 80 GET /images/picture.jpg - 200 Mozilla/4.0+(compatible;MSIE+5.5;+Windows+2000+Server)
```

The time-taken field is initialized when the HTTP Server API receives the first byte, before the request is parsed. The time-taken timestamp is stopped when the last send completion occurs. Time-taken does not reflect time across the network. The first request to the site shows a slightly longer time taken than other similar requests because the HTTP Server API opens the log file with the first request.
