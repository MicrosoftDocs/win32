# Netsh commands for HTTP

You can use the Netsh commands for HTTP context to query and configure HTTP.sys settings and parameters.

You can run these commands at the command prompt in the Windows Vista operating system or at the command prompt for the **netsh http** context. For these commands to work at the command prompt in Windows Vista, you must type **netsh http** before typing commands and parameters as they appear in the syntax below. To view help for a command at the command prompt, type *CommandName***/?**, where *CommandName* is the name of the command.

To view the command syntax, see the commands:
