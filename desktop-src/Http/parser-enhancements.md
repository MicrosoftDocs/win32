# Parser Enhancements

In Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1), the HTTP Server API allows the following requests from HTTP clients.

-   Requests that use a single Line Feed (LF) as line terminators.
-   Requests that contain linear white space (LWS) between the HTTP request line and start of headers.

These behaviors are enabled by default and are not controlled by registry settings.
