# HttpCfg.exe

This tool helps you configure the HTTP Server API by wrapping the HTTP [Configuration APIs](configuration-apis.md) for the following parameters:

-   IP Listen List
-   SSL Certificates
-   Namespace Reservations

HttpCfg.exe ships with the operating system starting with Windows Server 2003 as a binary executable, together with a help file that describes how to use it. It can be installed from the operating-system distribution disk as a support tool.

HttpCfg.exe is also available as a download; see [Windows XP SP2 Support Tools](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=49AE8576-9BB9-4126-9761-BA8011FABF38).

**Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008:** HttpCfg.exe is obsolete and replaced by similar functionality in netsh.exe.
