# Types of Errors Logged by the HTTP Server API

The HTTP Server API logs error responses to clients, connection time-outs, orphaned requests, and dropped connections that are handled incorrectly.

The following table lists errors logged by HTTP.



| Error                                                                                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| <span id="Responses_to_clients"></span><span id="responses_to_clients"></span><span id="RESPONSES_TO_CLIENTS"></span>"Responses to clients"<br/> | The HTTP Server API sends an error response to a client, for example, a 400 error caused by a parse error in the last received request. After sending the error response, the HTTP Server API terminates the connection.<br/> |
| <span id="Connection_time-outs"></span><span id="connection_time-outs"></span><span id="CONNECTION_TIME-OUTS"></span>"Connection time-outs"<br/> | The HTTP Server API times out a connection. If a request is pending when the connection times out, it is used to provide more information about the connection in the error log.<br/>                                         |
| <span id="Orphaned_requests"></span><span id="orphaned_requests"></span><span id="ORPHANED_REQUESTS"></span>"Orphaned requests"<br/>             | A user-mode process terminates unexpectedly while there are still queued requests that are routed to that process. The HTTP Server API logs the orphaned requests in the error log.<br/>                                      |



 

Specific error types are designated by Reason Phrase strings that always appear as the last field of each error line. The following table lists HTTP Reason Phrases.
