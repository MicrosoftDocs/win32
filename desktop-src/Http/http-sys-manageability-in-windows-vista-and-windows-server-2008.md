# HTTP.sys Manageability in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008

With Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, IT professionals will find improved manageability functionality for the HTTP Server API component, in addition to the HTTP logging support introduced in Windows Server 2003. To diagnose and configure the HTTP Server API component, IT professionals can use three tools:

-   New ETW tracing functionality
-   Performance counters
-   Netsh configuration commands

The HTTP Server API enables applications to communicate over HTTP and includes SSL support so that applications can exchange data over secure HTTP connections. The HTTP Server API is supported on the Windows Server 2003 operating systems, and on Windows XP SP2.

See the following sections:
