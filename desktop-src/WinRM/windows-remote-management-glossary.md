# Windows Remote Management Glossary


<dl> <dt>

****wsman:Items****
</dt> <dd>

A WS-Management protocol element returned in an enumeration that obtains both the instances and the instance [*EPRs*](/windows). **wsman:Items** is a container that holds an instance and its EPR. This type of enumeration is initiated when the **WSManFlagReturnObjectAndEPR** flag is set in the request.

</dd> </dl>

## B

<dl> <dt>

**baseboard management controller (BMC)**
</dt> <dd>

A microcontroller attached locally to a server. BMCs have sensors that monitor the physical state of the server and a separate network connection that can communicate over the network, even if the server is offline. You have access to BMC data through the [*Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI)*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md) WMI provider.

</dd> <dt>

**Basic authentication**
</dt> <dd>

The user name and password sent in the authentication exchange. Basic authentication can be configured to use either HTTP or HTTPS transport in a domain or workgroup. This method is the least secure method of authentication.

</dd> <dt>

**BMC**
</dt> <dd>

See [*baseboard management controller (BMC)*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md).

</dd> </dl>

## C

<dl> <dt>

**CIM**
</dt> <dd>

See [*Common Information Model (CIM)*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md).

</dd> <dt>

**client**
</dt> <dd>

The client application using the WS-Management protocol to access the management service on either the local or a remote computer.

</dd> <dt>

**Common Information Model (CIM)**
</dt> <dd>

The [*Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF)*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md) model that describes how to represent real-world computer and network objects. CIM uses an object-oriented paradigm, where managed objects are modeled using the concepts of classes and instances.

</dd> </dl>

## D

<dl> <dt>

**Digest authentication**
</dt> <dd>

An exchange wherein the server receives a request from a client and sends data about the client to an authenticating server, typically a domain controller. If the client is authenticated, then the server receives a Digest session key used to authenticate subsequent requests from the client.

</dd> <dt>

**Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF)**
</dt> <dd>

The industry organization developing management standards and integration technology for enterprise and Internet environments.

</dd> <dt>

</dd> <dt>

**endpoint reference (EPR)**
</dt> <dd>

A combination of WS-Addressing and WS-Management addressing elements that together describe an address for a resource in the message SOAP header. This is a web service term.

</dd> <dt>

**enumeration**
</dt> <dd>

A set, or collection, of [*resource*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md) instances or the action of requesting such a set. In WS-Management protocol, [*WS-Enumeration*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md) is used to obtain the collection. In the WinRM service scripting implementation of enumeration, [**Session.Enumerate**](session-enumerate.md) and the [**Enumerator**](enumerator.md) object are used. The corresponding C++ method and interface are [**IWSManSession::Enumerate**](/windows/desktop/api/WSManDisp/nf-wsmandisp-iwsmansession-enumerate) and [**IWSManEnumerator**](/windows/desktop/api/WSManDisp/nn-wsmandisp-iwsmanenumerator).

</dd> <dt>

**Event Collection Service**
</dt> <dd>

The operating system component that receives events from the BMC and other operating system components or applications.

</dd> <dt>

**event forwarding**
</dt> <dd>

A notification of events that occur on remote computers can be sent to subscribing applications. Event forwarding is not a feature of WinRM, but of the [Windows Event Log](/windows/desktop/WES/windows-event-log). Event forwarding becomes available for the first time in WindowsÂ Vista. The Management applications, such as Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM) use event forwarding.

</dd> </dl>

</dd> </dl>

## L

<dl> <dt>

**listener**
</dt> <dd>

A management service that implements WS-Management protocol to send and receive messages. WinRM is a listener service. A listener is defined by a transport (HTTP or HTTPS) and an IPv4 or IPv6 address. You can create more than one WinRM listener instance on a single computer by giving them a different TCP/IP address or port number.

</dd> </dl>

## M

<dl> <dt>

**message**
</dt> <dd>

A package of information transmitted between computers or separate networks constructed with the [*SOAP*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md) protocol. The package has a header, that describes the message target and transport, and a body that contains the content to be used when the message arrives. A message is a combination of elements from specifications such as [*WS-Addressing*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md), [*WS-Transfer*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md), and [*WS-Management*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md).

</dd> </dl>

## N

<dl> <dt>

**namespace**
</dt> <dd>

A [*WMI*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md) namespace, which is a logical grouping of WMI classes and instances to control scope and access. The most frequent source of management data for systems running Windows is the root\\cimv2 namespace, which contains classes such as [**Win32\_Process**](/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32-process). Namespaces appear in the resource URI for WMI classes, for example `https://schemas.microsoft.com/wbem/wsman/1/wmi/root/cimv2/Win32\_Service`.

</dd> <dt>

**Negotiate authentication**
</dt> <dd>

A negotiated, single sign on type of authentication that is the Windows implementation of [*Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO)*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md). SPNEGO negotiation determines whether authentication is handled by Kerberos or NTLM. Kerberos is the preferred mechanism. Negotiate authentication on Windows-based systems is also called Windows Integrated Authentication.

</dd> <dt>

**numeric sensor**
</dt> <dd>

A numeric type of sensor in a [*baseboard management controller (BMC)*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md), for example temperature or voltage.

</dd> </dl>

## O

<dl> <dt>

**option**
</dt> <dd>

Option support is found in the [**ResourceLocator**](resourcelocator.md) object.

</dd> <dt>

**out-of-band**
</dt> <dd>

The client application obtains data directly from the [*baseboard management controller (BMC)*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md) of another computer, rather than through the WinRM [*listener*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md) in the operating system.

</dd> </dl>

## P

<dl> <dt>

**pull**
</dt> <dd>

A [*WS-Enumeration*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md) pull message is sent to continue an enumeration started by an initial call to WS-Enumeration:Enumerate. The pull operation in the WinRM service is performed by [**Enumerator.ReadItem**](enumerator-readitem.md) or [**IWSManEnumerator::ReadItem**](/windows/desktop/api/WSManDisp/nf-wsmandisp-iwsmanenumerator-readitem).

</dd> </dl>

## R

<dl> <dt>

**resource**
</dt> <dd>

## W

<dl> <dt>

**web service**
</dt> <dd>

A software application used for interaction between computers across the Internet or a network. Web services are described by the [*Web Service Description Language (WSDL)*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md). The specific description of the web service tells other services how to interact with the web service by using SOAP messages. The messages are conveyed between computers by a transport, typically HTTP or HTTPS. [*WS-Addressing*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md), [*WS-Eventing*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md), and [*WS-Management*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md) are examples of protocols used by web service applications to communicate with each other.

</dd> <dt>

**Web Service Description Language (WSDL)**
</dt> <dd>

An XML-based language used to define how to interact with a web service. Typically, the WSDL describes what SOAP messages the web service requires to return data or carry out operations. The WSDL allows an implementation from one operating system to communicate with the web service implemented on another operating system, as long as the requirements of the WSDL are met.

</dd> <dt>

**WS-Enumeration (wsen)**
</dt> <dd>

A public standard protocol, which is SOAP-based, for enumerating a sequence of XML elements that may represent data collections, logs, or other linear information structures. WS-Enumeration is one of the web service protocols which compose the WS-Management protocol.

</dd> <dt>

**WS-Eventing (wse)**
</dt> <dd>

A public standard protocol, which is SOAP-based, that allows one web service (the subscriber) to subscribe to and accept event notification messages from another web service (the event source). WS-Eventing is one of the web service protocols which compose the WS-Management protocol.

</dd> <dt>

**WS-Management**
</dt> <dd>

A public standard protocol, which is SOAP-based, for sharing management data among all operating systems, computers, and devices. All [*messages*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md) sent by the WinRM client or server components use this protocol.

</dd> <dt>

**WS-Transfer (wxf)**
</dt> <dd>

A public standard protocol, which is SOAP-based, for accessing XML representations of web service-based resources through a simple set of verbs such as Get, Put, Invoke, or Delete. WS-Transfer defines operations for sending and receiving the representation of a particular resource and operations for creating or deleting a resource and its corresponding representation.

</dd> </dl>

## X

<dl> <dt>

**XPath**
</dt> <dd>

A path notation for addressing parts of an XML document, similar to a URL. An XPath expression is a sequence of phrases to get from the current location in the XML document to another node or set of nodes. The phrases are separated by forward-slash ("/") characters. The WinRM service supports [XPath](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/ms256115(v=vs.100)) for [*fragment dialect*](windows-remote-management-glossary.md).
