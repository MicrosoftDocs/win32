# Security and Identity

Develop more secure desktop apps by using Windows APIs and services. These APIs provide:

-   Authentication
-   Authorization
-   Cryptography
-   Directory, identity, and access services
-   Parental controls
-   Rights management

This section also provides best practices and other security articles.
