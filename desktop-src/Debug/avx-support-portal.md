# Intel AVX

## Purpose

Intel Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) is a 256-bit SIMD floating point vector extension of Intel architecture. It includes extensions to both instruction and register sets.

Microsoft has developed some API enhancements, such as XState functions, that enable applications to access and manipulate extended processor feature information and state, including Intel AVX.
