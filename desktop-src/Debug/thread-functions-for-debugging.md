# Thread Functions for Debugging

The [**CreateThread**](/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createthread) function creates a new thread for a process. Debuggers typically need to examine or change the contents of a thread's registers. To accomplish this, a debugger must obtain a handle to the thread by using the [**DuplicateHandle**](/windows/win32/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-duplicatehandle) function and specifying the appropriate access to the thread (THREAD\_GET\_CONTEXT, THREAD\_SET\_CONTEXT, or both). The [**OpenThread**](/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openthread) function enables a debugger to obtain the identifier of an existing thread.

A process with appropriate access to a thread can examine the thread's registers by using the [**GetThreadContext**](/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-getthreadcontext) function and set the contents of the thread's registers by using the [**SetThreadContext**](/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-setthreadcontext) function.

A process can also obtain THREAD\_SUSPEND\_RESUME access to a thread. This type of access enables a debugger to control a thread's execution with the [**SuspendThread**](/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-suspendthread) and [**ResumeThread**](/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-resumethread) functions. For more information about threads, see [Processes and Threads](../procthread/processes-and-threads.md).
