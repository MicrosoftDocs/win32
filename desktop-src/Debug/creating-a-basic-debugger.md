# Creating a Basic Debugger

[Debugging a Running Process](debugging-a-running-process.md) describes attaching the debugger to a running process. [Writing the Debugger's Main Loop](writing-the-debugger-s-main-loop.md) describes the functions used in the debugger's main loop of execution.

Although most of the debugging functions are used to create a debugger, several functions are designed for use in the process being debugged. For more information, see [Communicating with the Debugger](communicating-with-the-debugger.md).
