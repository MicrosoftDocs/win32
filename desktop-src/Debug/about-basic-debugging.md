# About Basic Debugging

The [debugging functions](debugging-functions.md) can be used to create a basic, event-driven debugger. *Event-driven* means that the debugger is notified every time certain events occur in the process being debugged. Notification enables the debugger to take appropriate action in response to the events.

For an overview of debugging terms, see [Debugging Terminology](debugging-terminology.md).

[Debug Support from Process, Thread, and Exception Functions](debug-support-from-process-thread-and-exception-functions.md) describes the debugging-specific features of certain process, thread, and exception-handling functions.

[Creating a Basic Debugger](creating-a-basic-debugger.md) describes using the basic debugging functions to create a simple debugger. These functions enable an application to wait for debugging events, cause breakpoint exceptions, transfer execution control to the debugger, and so on.

[Debugging Events](debugging-events.md) describes the debug event mechanism. Debugging events cause the system to notify the debugger.
