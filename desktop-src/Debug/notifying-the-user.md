# Notifying the User

To notify the user that some kind of error has occurred, many applications simply produce a sound by using the [**MessageBeep**](/windows/desktop/api/WinUser/nf-winuser-messagebeep) function or flash the window by using either the [**FlashWindow**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-flashwindow) or [**FlashWindowEx**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-flashwindowex) function. An application can also use these functions to call attention to an error and then display a message box or an error message containing details about the error.
