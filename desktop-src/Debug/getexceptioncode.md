# GetExceptionCode macro

Retrieves a code that identifies the type of exception that occurs. The function can be called only from within the filter expression or exception-handler block of an exception handler.

> [!Note]  
> The Microsoft C/C++ Optimizing Compiler interprets this function as a keyword, and its use outside the appropriate exception-handling syntax generates a compiler error.

Â 

## Syntax


```C++
DWORD GetExceptionCode(void);
```



## Parameters

This macro has no parameters.

## Return value

The return value identifies the type of exception. The following table identifies the exception codes that can occur due to common programming errors. These values are defined in WinBase.h and WinNT.h.

## Remarks

The **GetExceptionCode** function can be called only from within the filter expression or exception-handler block of an exception handler. The filter expression is evaluated if an exception occurs during execution of the **\_\_try** block, and it determines whether or not the **\_\_except** block is executed.

The filter expression can invoke a filter function. The filter function cannot call **GetExceptionCode**. However, the return value of **GetExceptionCode** can be passed as a parameter to a filter function. The return value of the [**GetExceptionInformation**](getexceptioninformation.md) function can also be passed as a parameter to a filter function. **GetExceptionInformation** returns a pointer to a structure that includes the exception code information.

When nested handlers exist, each filter expression is evaluated until one is evaluated as EXCEPTION\_EXECUTE\_HANDLER or EXCEPTION\_CONTINUE\_EXECUTION. Each filter expression can invoke **GetExceptionCode** to get the exception code.

The exception code returned is the code generated by a hardware exception, or the code specified in the [**RaiseException**](/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-raiseexception) function for a software generated exception.

When handling the breakpoint exception, it is important to increment the instruction pointer in the context record to continue from this exception.

## Examples

For an example, see [Using an Exception Handler](using-an-exception-handler.md).
