# Exception Handling (Error Handling)

Exceptions can be initiated by hardware or software, and can occur in kernel-mode as well as user-mode code. Structured exception handling provides a single mechanism for the handling of kernel-mode and user-mode exceptions.

The execution of certain instruction sequences can result in exceptions that are initiated by hardware. For example, an access violation is generated by the hardware when a process attempts to read from or write to a virtual address to which it does not have the appropriate access.

Events that require exception handling may also occur during execution of a software routine (for example, when an invalid parameter value is specified). When this happens, a thread can initiate an exception explicitly by calling the [**RaiseException**](/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-raiseexception) function. This function enables the calling thread to specify information that describes the exception.

An exception can be continuable or noncontinuable. A noncontinuable exception arises when the event is not continuable in the hardware, or if continuation makes no sense. A noncontinuable exception does not terminate the application. Therefore, an application may be able to catch the exception and run. However, a noncontinuable exception typically arises as a result of a corrupted stack or other serious problem, making it difficult to recover from the exception.
