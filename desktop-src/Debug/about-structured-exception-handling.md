# About Structured Exception Handling

The structured exception handling and termination handling mechanisms are integral parts of the system; they enable the system to be robust. You can use these mechanisms to create consistently robust and reliable applications.

Structured exception handling is made available primarily through compiler support. For example, the Microsoft C/C++ Optimizing Compiler supports the **\_\_try** keyword that identifies a guarded body of code, the **\_\_except** keyword that identifies an exception handler, and the **\_\_finally** keyword that identifies a termination handler. Although this overview uses examples specific to the Microsoft C/C++ compiler, other compilers provide this support as well.
