# Debug Support from Process, Thread, and Exception Functions

Some functions essential to debugging are actually classified as process, thread, or exception-handling functions. For a description of how to start a process that is going to be debugged, see [Process Functions](process-functions-for-debugging.md). For information on how to examine and manipulate the context and execution of a thread, see [Thread Functions](thread-functions-for-debugging.md). For a description of how a debugger should handle exceptions, see [Exception Handling Functions](exception-handling-functions-for-debugging.md).
