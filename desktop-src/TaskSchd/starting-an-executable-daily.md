# Starting an Executable Daily

Writing a task that starts an executable on a daily basis is done by defining a daily trigger and an executable action.

## Daily Triggers

Daily triggers use their start boundary to activate the trigger and to specify the time of day that the task is run. Once the trigger is activated, the triggers interval is used to indicate if the task runs daily, every other day, every third day, or so on.

## Daily Trigger Examples

The following examples show how to create tasks that start Notepad on a daily basis.

-   [Daily Trigger Example (Scripting)](daily-trigger-example--scripting-.md)
-   [Daily Trigger Example (C++)](daily-trigger-example--c---.md)
-   [Daily Trigger Example (XML)](daily-trigger-example--xml-.md)
