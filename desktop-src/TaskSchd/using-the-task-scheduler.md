# Using the Task Scheduler

This section contains code examples that illustrate how the Task Scheduler API is used and XML examples that show how tasks are defined in the Task Scheduler schema. Most of these examples are stand-alone code that can be run independently, or pasted into a larger application and modified to the requirements of the application.

The following table lists Task Scheduler 2.0 examples included in this section.
