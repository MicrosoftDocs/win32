## Remarks

The time of day that the task is started is set by the [**StartBoundary**](trigger-startboundary.md) property.

When reading or writing your own XML for a task, a weekly trigger is specified using the [**ScheduleByWeek**](taskschedulerschema-schedulebyweek-calendartriggertype-element.md) element of the Task Scheduler schema.

On the day that Daylight savings time (DST) starts in a year, for a Pacific time zone (time shifted from 2:00 AM -> 3:00 AM in 2022), any task that is scheduled to run between 2:00 AM to 2:59:59:999 AM, will run at the earliest possible time that actually exists in that given day i.e 3:00 AM. This applies to all DST time zones based on the various times at which they observe DST.

Consider a monthly task that is set to run every Sunday of 2022 at 2:30 AM in the Pacific time zone, such that the next run time is Mar 13, 2022 2:30 AM. As 2:30 AM is a time that doesn't exist on Mar 13, 2022, the task runs at 3:00 AM instead. On other Sundays of the year, the task runs as usual at 2:30 AM.
