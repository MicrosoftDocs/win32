# System Restore

## Purpose

System Restore automatically monitors and records key system changes on a user's computer. It is designed to reduce support costs and increase customer satisfaction by enabling a user to undo a change that may have caused a problem with the system, or revert to a day when the system was performing optimally.

## Run-time requirements

The System Restore API is supported on client operating systems starting with Windows XP. For information about which operating systems are required to use a particular API element, see the Requirements section of its documentation.
