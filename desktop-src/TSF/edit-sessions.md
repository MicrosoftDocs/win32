# Edit Sessions

When a text service must obtain, modify, or set text in a context, it must request an *edit session*. When an edit session is requested, the TSF manager negotiates with the owner of the target context for a document lock of the requested type. When the document lock is granted, the TSF manager enables the text service to read and/or write text to or from the context.
