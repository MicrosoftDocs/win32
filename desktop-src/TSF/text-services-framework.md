# Text Services Framework

## Purpose

Microsoft Windows Text Services Framework (TSF) is a system service available as a redistributable for Windows 2000. TSF provides a simple and scalable framework for the delivery of advanced text input and natural language technologies. TSF can be enabled in applications, or as a TSF text service. A TSF text service provides multilingual support and delivers text services such as keyboard processors, handwriting recognition, and speech recognition.

## Where applicable

Text Services Framework is applicable for Windows-based computers using text services and Windows XP or later versions of the operating system.

## Developer audience

Text Services Framework is designed for use by Component Object Model (COM) programmers using the C/C++ programming languages. Programmers should be familiar with text services for Windows-based computers. Knowledge of handwriting recognition, speech recognition, and programming for multilingual support is recommended.

## Run-time requirements

Text Services Framework is available as a redistributable for Windows 2000. For more information about the requirements of specific API elements, see the Requirements section in the reference documentation. To download the latest redistributable, go to [Windows Server 2003 SP1 Platform SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A55B6B43-E24F-4EA3-A93E-40C0EC4F68E5).
