# Listening for Ribbon Events

The Windows Ribbon framework uses the [Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)](../etw/event-tracing-portal.md) infrastructure to enable developers to learn how users are interacting with their application's ribbon.

## Introduction

The Ribbon framework event mechanism is designed such that the framework reports ribbon UI events to the application so you can monitor user activity, learn their interaction patterns, and assess usage trends. This information can be used to refine the user experience for future iterations of your ribbon app.

Using the Ribbon framework events involves the following:

1.  The ribbon application must register an [Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)](../etw/event-tracing-portal.md) listener to receive ribbon event notifications from the Ribbon framework.
2.  The Ribbon framework fires ribbon UI event callbacks at run time, if the application has registered an [Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)](../etw/event-tracing-portal.md) listener.

## Supported events

The events exposed to ribbon applications are described in the following table. 


| Event | Event report | 
|-------|--------------|
| Tab activated | Command ID<br /> Command name<br /> Event verb<br /> | 
| Contextual tab activated | Command ID<br /> Command name<br /> Event verb<br /> |
