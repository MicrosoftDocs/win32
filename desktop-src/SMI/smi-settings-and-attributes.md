If a user changes a perUser setting, then no other user on the system will notice the change. Settings that reside in **HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER** are generally "perUser" settings.

If one user changes a shared setting, then all users are affected, as they all see the change. Settings that reside in **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE** are usually "allUsers" settings. The setting is installed in a shared space and there is only one value shared between all users.                                                                                            |

IP address is a classic example. Other settings such as user preference are generally independent of the operating system (computer).
