# Using the PDH Functions to Consume Counter Data

You use the PDH functions to collect performance data. The PDH functions are easier to use than the [registry functions](using-the-registry-functions-to-consume-counter-data.md), oriented more towards operations on single counters rather than groups of counters, and can be used to access counter data from current activity or log files.

To collect performance data using the PDH functions, perform the following steps.

1.  [Create a query](creating-a-query.md)
2.  [Add counters to the query](creating-a-query.md)
3.  [Collect the performance data](collecting-performance-data.md)
4.  [Display the performance data](displaying-performance-data.md)
5.  [Close the query](creating-a-query.md)

You can collect performance data from either real-time sources or log files. You can display the collected data or write the data to log files. For more information on how to write performance data to log files, see [Working with Log Files](working-with-log-files.md).
