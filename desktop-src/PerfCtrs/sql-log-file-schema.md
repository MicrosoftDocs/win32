# SQL Log File Schema

Applications can use PDH to extract performance counters from SQL logs, or they can extract formatted or raw counters directly from the database through SQL queries. This section describes the SQL schema used to store performance counters. You can use this information to create custom views and reports. The schema consists of the following three tables:

-   [**CounterData**](counterdata.md)
-   [**CounterDetails**](counterdetails.md)
-   [**DisplayToID**](displaytoid.md)
