# Performance Counters Reference

Use the following programming elements to write applications that consume or provide performance counter data:

- [Performance Counters Functions](performance-counters-functions.md)
- [Performance Counters Functions for Visual Basic](performance-counters-functions-for-visual-basic.md)
- [Performance Counters Structures](performance-counters-structures.md)
- [Performance Counters Enumerations](performance-counter-enumerations.md)
- [Performance Counters Types](performance-counters-types.md)
- [Performance Data Helper Error Codes](pdh-error-codes.md)
- [SQL Log File Schema](sql-log-file-schema.md)

This section also describes:

- The [schema elements](performance-counters-schema.md) that you use in your V2 provider manifest to define your performance counters.
- The [CTRPP](ctrpp.md) tool that parses your manifest and generates the code that defines the layout of the counter data in your V2 provider.
