# Performance Counters Elements

The Performance Counters schema defines the following elements:

-   [**counter (counterSet)**](performance-counters-counter--counterset--element.md)
-   [**counterAttribute (counterAttributes)**](performance-counters-counterattribute--counterattributes--element.md)
-   [**counterAttributes (counter)**](performance-counters-counterattributes--counter--element.md)
-   [**counters**](performance-counters-counters-element.md)
-   [**counterSet (provider)**](performance-counters-counterset--provider--element.md)
-   [**provider (counters)**](performance-counters-provider--counters--element.md)
-   [**struct (structs)**](performance-counters-struct--structs--element.md)
-   [**structs (counterSet)**](performance-counters-structs--counterset--element.md)

This section contains the names of the elements that you use in your manifest; however, to get the details for each element, see the complex type that contains the element. The root element of the performance counters section of the manifest is the [**counters**](performance-counters-counters-element.md) element.
