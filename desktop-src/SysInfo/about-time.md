Time-related functions return time in one of several formats. You can use the time functions to convert between some time formats for ease of comparison and display. The following table summarizes the time formats.

| Local           | [**SYSTEMTIME**](systemtime-str.md) or [**FILETIME**](filetime-str.md) | A system time or file time converted to the system's local time zone.                                                               |
| File            | [**FILETIME**](filetime-str.md)                                         | The number of 100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601.                                                                       |

| Interrupt Count | **ULONGLONG**                                                            | The number of 100-nanosecond intervals since the system was last started.                                                           |
