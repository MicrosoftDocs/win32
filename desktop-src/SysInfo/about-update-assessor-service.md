# About the WaaS Assessment Platform

The following topic describes how the Windows as a Service (WaaS) Assessment Platform API works.

The WaaS Assessment API offers the caller the following information:

-   If a device is on the latest Microsoft updates.
-   Whether the device has reached end of support.
-   The release times for the latest applicable updates for the device.
-   An assessment of why a device is not up-to-date and the potential impact it may have on the device.

The WaaS Assessment Platform uses the COM API model and runs automatically at least once a day. This cycle catches applicable release information. During the cached period, assessments are made against the cached release information. If a call is made outside of the cache expiration window, a fresh call and assessment is made, cached, and returned. When a call is made, the WaaS Assessment Client contacts the WaaS Assessment Service with the device's attributes, and receives back a dossier of information applicable to the device. The client then uses this information against the information it gathers about the device to perform the assessment.

> [!NOTE]
> Your code must have administrator privileges to call the Waas Assessment API. For more details about developing applications that require administrator privileges, see [this article](../secauthz/developing-applications-that-require-administrator-privilege.md).
