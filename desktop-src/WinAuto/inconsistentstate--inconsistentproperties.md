# InconsistentState, InconsistentProperties

## Text

A control has states/properties that are inconsistent {0} and {1}

## Type

Error

## Description

An element is reporting inconsistent or conflicting MSAA states or UI Automation properties. For example, when the [**get\_accState**](/windows/win32/Oleacc/nf-oleacc-iaccessible-get_accstate?branch=master) method returns any of the following combinations.

-   STATE\_SYSTEM\_EXPANDED and STATE\_SYSTEM\_COLLAPSED
-   STATE\_SYSTEM\_SELECTED and not STATE\_SYSTEM\_SELECTABLE
-   STATE\_SYSTEM\_FOCUSED and not STATE\_SYSTEM\_FOCUSABLE

This issue causes problems for people who rely on a screen-reader and keyboard for navigation because an incorrect element state might be reported to the user.

## Possible causes

The element or its parent has an MSAA state set inappropriately.
