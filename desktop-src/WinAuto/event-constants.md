# Event Constants (Winuser.h)

This topic describes the events that are generated by the operating system and by server applications. The constants are listed in alphabetical order.

Prior to using these events, client applications should use [Accessible Event Watcher](accessible-event-watcher.md) to verify that these events are used by UI elements.

For more information about events in general, see [What Are WinEvents?](what-are-winevents.md) and [System Level and Object Level Events](system-level-and-object-level-events.md). For more information about the events sent by the system, see [Appendix A: Supported User Interface Elements Reference](appendix-a--supported-user-interface-elements-reference.md).

Server applications send this event for their accessible objects.<br/> Clients assume that all of an object's children are destroyed when the parent object sends this event.<br/> After receiving this event, clients do not call an object's [**IAccessible**](/windows/desktop/api/oleacc/nn-oleacc-iaccessible) properties or methods. However, the interface pointer must remain valid as long as there is a reference count on it (due to COM rules), but the UI element may no longer be present. Further calls on the interface pointer may return failure errors; to prevent this, servers [create proxy objects](creating-proxy-objects.md) and monitor their life spans.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

A client might need to query the host window to discover the new hosted objects, especially if the client has been monitoring events from the window. A hosted object is an object from an accessibility framework (MSAA or UI Automation) that is different from that of the host. Changes in hosted objects that are from the same framework as the host should be handed with the structural change events, such as **EVENT\_OBJECT\_CREATE** for MSAA.

The system sends this event for the following user interface elements: caret and window objects. Server applications send this event for their accessible objects. <br/> This event is generated in response to a change in the top-level object within the object hierarchy; it is not generated for any children that the object might have. For example, if the user resizes a window, the system sends this notification for the window, but not for the menu bar, title bar, scroll bar, or other objects that have also changed.<br/> The system does not send this event for every non-floating child window when the parent moves. However, if an application explicitly resizes child windows as a result of resizing the parent window, the system sends multiple events for the resized children.<br/> If an object's [State property](state-property.md) is set to [**STATE\_SYSTEM\_FLOATING**](object-state-constants.md), the server sends **EVENT\_OBJECT\_LOCATIONCHANGE** whenever the object changes location. If an object does not have this state, servers only trigger this event when the object moves in relation to its parent. For this event notification, the *idChild* parameter of the [*WinEventProc*](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nc-winuser-wineventproc) callback function identifies the child object that has changed.<br/> |
