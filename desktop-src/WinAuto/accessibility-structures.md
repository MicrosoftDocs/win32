| [**ACCESSTIMEOUT**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-accesstimeout)<br/> | Contains information about the time-out period associated with the Microsoft Win32 accessibility features. <br/> The accessibility time-out period is the length of time that must pass without keyboard and mouse input before the operating system automatically turns off accessibility features. The accessibility time-out is designed for computers that are shared by several users so that options selected by one user do not inconvenience a subsequent user.<br/> The accessibility features affected by the time-out are the FilterKeys features (SlowKeys, BounceKeys, and RepeatKeys), MouseKeys, ToggleKeys, and StickyKeys. The accessibility time-out also affects the high contrast mode setting.<br/> |
| [**FILTERKEYS**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-filterkeys)<br/>       | Contains information about the FilterKeys accessibility feature, which enables a user with disabilities to set the keyboard repeat rate (RepeatKeys), acceptance delay (SlowKeys), and bounce rate (BounceKeys). <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [**HIGHCONTRAST**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-highcontrasta)<br/>   | Contains information about the high contrast accessibility feature.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [**MOUSEKEYS**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-mousekeys)<br/>         | Contains information about the MouseKeys accessibility feature. When the MouseKeys feature is active, the user can use the numeric keypad to control the mouse pointer, and to click, double-click, drag, and drop. By pressing NUMLOCK, the user can toggle the numeric keypad between mouse control mode and normal operation. <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [**SERIALKEYS**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-serialkeysa)<br/>       | Contains information about the SerialKeys accessibility feature, which interprets data from a communication aid attached to a serial port as commands causing the system to simulate keyboard and mouse input. <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [**SOUNDSENTRY**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-soundsentrya)<br/>     | Contains information about the SoundSentry accessibility feature. When the SoundSentry feature is on, the computer displays a visual indication only when a sound is generated.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [**STICKYKEYS**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-stickykeys)<br/>       | Contains information about the StickyKeys accessibility feature. When the StickyKeys feature is on, the user can press a modifier key (SHIFT, CTRL, or ALT) and then another key in sequence rather than at the same time, to enter shifted (modified) characters and other key combinations.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
