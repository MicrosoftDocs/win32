# Content of Descriptive Properties

The [**IAccessible**](/windows/desktop/api/oleacc/nn-oleacc-iaccessible) interface provides descriptive properties, which describe various aspects of an object. Some of these properties are content specific; other properties have content consisting of descriptive text that is provided by the server. The type of information for each property varies depending on the object.

The following topics describe information that clients obtain from these properties. They also provide servers with suggestions for choosing content.

-   [Name Property](name-property.md)
-   [Role Property](role-property.md)
-   [State Property](state-property.md)
-   [Value Property](value-property.md)
-   [Description Property](description-property.md)
-   [Help Property](help-property.md)
-   [HelpTopic Property](helptopic-property.md)
-   [KeyboardShortcut Property](keyboardshortcut-property.md)
-   [DefaultAction Property](defaultaction-property.md)

When designing accessible objects, server developers should also refer to the following topics:

-   [Choosing Which Properties to Support](choosing-which-properties-to-support.md)
-   [Choosing the Content for Descriptive Properties](choosing-the-content-for-descriptive-properties.md)

For information about the parameters and return values of these properties, see the [**IAccessible**](/windows/desktop/api/oleacc/nn-oleacc-iaccessible) section of the Microsoft Active Accessibility[C/C++ Reference](c-c---reference.md).
