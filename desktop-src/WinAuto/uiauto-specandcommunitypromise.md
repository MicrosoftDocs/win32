# UI Automation Specification and Community Promise

The UI Automation Specification provides information about Microsoft accessibility frameworks, including Microsoft Active Accessibility and Microsoft UI Automation. It discusses each framework's main components, provides design considerations and examples, and describes requirements for implementation. For more information, see [UI Automation Specification](ui-automation-specification.md).

The UI Automation Community Promise enables anyone to freely implement the UI Automation Specification without needing to sign any agreements with Microsoft. Further, there is no need to make any mention of, or any reference to, Microsoft. For more information, see [UI Automation Community Promise](uiauto-specandcommunitypromise.md).

## UI Automation Specification

The UI Automation Specification provides information about Microsoft's accessibility frameworks, including Active Accessibility, UI Automation, and UI Automation Express.

### Legal Notice

Permission to copy, display, and distribute the contents of this document (the "Specification"), in any medium for any purpose without fee or royalty is hereby granted, provided that you include the following notice on ALL copies of the Specification, or portions thereof, that you make:

Copyright © Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Permission to copy, display, and distribute this document is available at [UI Automation Community Promise](uiauto-specandcommunitypromise.md).

You may create derivative works of the Specification, provided that you include all required portions of the Specification in your derivative work, and provide the notice above.

There is a separate patent promise available to parties interested in implementing software that conforms to the UI Automation Specification. This patent license is available at this location: [UI Automation Community Promise](uiauto-specandcommunitypromise.md)

The Specification is provided "as is" and Microsoft makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or title; that the contents of the Specification are suitable for any purpose; nor that the implementation of such contents will not infringe any third-party patents, copyrights, trademarks or other rights. Microsoft will not be liable for any direct, indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of or relating to any use or distribution of the Specification.

The name and trademarks of Microsoft may NOT be used in any manner, including advertising or publicity pertaining to the Specification or its contents without specific, written prior permission. Title to copyright in the Specification will at all times remain with Microsoft.

## UI Automation Community Promise

Microsoft irrevocably promises not to assert any Microsoft Necessary Claims against you for making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing or distributing any implementation, to the extent it conforms to one of the Covered Specifications, and is compliant with all of the required parts of the mandatory provisions of that specification ("Covered Implementation"), subject to the following:

This is a personal promise directly from Microsoft to you, and you acknowledge as a condition of benefitting from it that no Microsoft rights are received from suppliers, distributors, or otherwise in connection with this promise. If you file, maintain, or voluntarily participate in a patent infringement lawsuit against a Microsoft implementation of any Covered Specification, then this personal promise does not apply with respect to any Covered Implementation made or used by you. To clarify, "Microsoft Necessary Claims" are those claims of Microsoft-owned or Microsoft-controlled patents that are necessary to implement the required portions (which also include the required elements of optional portions) of the Covered Specification that are described in detail and not those merely referenced in the Covered Specification.

This promise by Microsoft is not an assurance that either (i) any of Microsoft's issued patent claims covers a Covered Implementation or are enforceable, or (ii) a Covered Implementation would not infringe patents or other intellectual property rights of any third party. No other rights except those expressly stated in this promise shall be deemed granted, waived or received by implication, exhaustion, estoppel, or otherwise.
