# Accessibility tools - AccEvent (Accessible Event Watcher)

**AccEvent (Accessible Event Watcher)** lets developers and testers to validate that an application's UI elements raise proper Microsoft UI Automation and Microsoft Active Accessibility events when UI changes occur. Changes in the UI can occur when focus changes, or when a UI element is invoked, selected, or has a state or property change.

**AccEvent** is installed with the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK). It is located in the \\bin\\<*version*>\\<*platform*> folder of the SDK installation path (Accevent.exe).

> [!NOTE]
> **AccEvent** is a legacy tool. We recommend using [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) instead.

## Requirements

**AccEvent** can be used to examine accessibility data on systems that don't have UI Automation, it was originally written for Microsoft Active Accessibility. To examine UI Automation, UI Automation must be present on the system. For more information, see the "Requirements" section of [UI Automation](entry-uiauto-win32.md).

**AccEvent** is installed as part of the overall set of tools in the Windows SDK, it is not distributed as a separate exe download. The Windows SDK includes all of the accessibility-related tools documented in this section. [Get the Windows SDK.](https://developer.microsoft.com/) (There's also an SDK download archive linked from that page, if you need a previous version.)

To run **AccEvent**, find AccEvent.exe in the \\bin\\<*version*>\\<*platform*> folder and run it (you don't typically have to run as administrator).

## The Accessible Event Watcher Window

When you launch **AccEvent**, the main window is displayed. The main **AccEvent** window displays the UI Automation or Microsoft Active Accessibility events raised by applications that are running. The main window has the following major parts:

- Title bar. Displays the current operating mode and state.
- Menu bar. Provides access to **AccEvent** functionality.
- Data view. Displays information about each event, including the event ID and selected properties of the UI element that raised the event.

**AccEvent** has a graphical user interface only; there are no command line arguments for this tool, but you could use other tools to process the output log as text.

The following image shows the main **AccEvent** window.

## Accessible Event Watcher Tasks

This section includes information about commonly used **AccEvent** tasks.

The **WinEvent Settings** dialog box is displayed. You can also use this dialog box to filter for events.

The **WinEvent Settings** dialog box contains the following panes:

- **Objects**

    - Select the **Exclude** radio button to display only the events raised from objects other than the specified windows.
    - Select the **Include only** radio button and specify one or more window handles to display only events raised from those windows.

    | Always Get Object (even if no object properties selected)     | Retrieves the object associated with the event even if no items are selected in the Object Properties pane.                                                                                        |
    | Display default property (in addition to selected properties) | Displays the default property, if any, for the object associated with the event, along with the items selected in the Object Properties pane.                                                      |
    | Display event information from invisible/hidden windows       | Displays the selected items from the Event Information pane for all objects, including those in invisible or hidden windows.                                                                       |

    | DebugBreak on next event                                      | Causes a breakpoint exception to occur in the process that originates the next WinEvent. This signals the debugger to handle the exception.                                                        |

### Using the Event Menu

Use the **Event** menu to perform the following tasks:

| When this option is selected | **AccEvent** does this                                    |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Start Listening              | Starts displaying event information in the Data view. |
| Stop Listening               | Stops displaying event information in the Data view.  |
| Clear Event History          | Clears the contents of the Data view.                 |
| Select All Events            | Selects all events listed in the Data view.           |
| Copy Selected Events         | Copies the selected events to the clipboard.          |

### Saving Active Accessibility Events

To begin saving events to a text file, open the **File** menu and select **Start Logging to File**. **AccEvent** begins writing events to the specified file until you select **Stop Logging** from the **File** menu. The text file can be useful for troubleshooting and reviewing the events at a later time.
