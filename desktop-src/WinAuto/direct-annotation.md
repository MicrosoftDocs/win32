# Direct Annotation

This section provides information about using direct annotation.

## Summary

Direct annotation is the simplest form of Dynamic Annotation. It is used to override the value of one or a limited number of properties of an accessible element. It is most useful for accessible elements whose annotated properties are not dependent upon the control's state and do not require the additional support provided by [value map annotation](value-map-annotation.md) and [server annotation](server-annotation.md).

## When to Use This Technique

Use this technique when you want to override the value of one or a limited number of properties for an accessible element.

For more information, see [Using Direct Annotation](using-direct-annotation.md).
