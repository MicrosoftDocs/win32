# AppearsToNotSupportTabbing

## Text

The application appears to not support tabbing.

## Type

Error

## Description

The application doesn't support standard keyboard navigation (Tab or Shift+Tab).

This issue causes usability problems for people who rely on a screen reader or the keyboard for navigation because none of the elements in the application are discoverable.

## Possible causes

-   The application's UI framework doesn't support MSAA.
-   MSAA is not implemented on any control in the application.
