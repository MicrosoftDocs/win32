# Shortcuts for Exposing Custom User Interface Elements

This section describes shortcuts that application developers can use to expose certain kinds of custom user interface elements. The techniques described in this section either simplify the implementation of the [**IAccessible**](/windows/desktop/api/oleacc/nn-oleacc-iaccessible) interface, or provide an alternative to exposing information without implementing **IAccessible**.

> [!Note]  
> You should consider using some form of Dynamic Annotation (Direct, Value Map, or Server) before attempting the techniques described in this section. For more information, see [Dynamic Annotation API](dynamic-annotation-api.md).
