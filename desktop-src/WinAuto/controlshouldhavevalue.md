# ControlShouldHaveValue

## Text

A control with role of {0} should have a value but get\_accValue is not implemented

## Type

Error

## Description

An element does not supply a value as expected based on the assigned MSAA role, implying that the element does not have the [**get\_accValue**](iaccessible-iaccessible--get-accvalue.md) method implemented. For example, the following MSAA roles should all supply a value.

-   ROLE\_SYSTEM\_COMBOBOX
-   ROLE\_SYSTEM\_IPADDRESS
-   ROLE\_SYSTEM\_LINK
-   ROLE\_SYSTEM\_OUTLINEITEM
-   ROLE\_SYSTEM\_PROGRESSBAR
-   ROLE\_SYSTEM\_SLIDER
-   ROLE\_SYSTEM\_SPINBUTTON
-   ROLE\_SYSTEM\_SCROLLBAR
-   ROLE\_SYSTEM\_TEXT

This issue is a problem for people who rely on a screen-reader and keyboard for navigation because an element that has an intrinsic value must be able to report that value to a user.

## Possible causes

The element or its parent has an MSAA role set inappropriately.
