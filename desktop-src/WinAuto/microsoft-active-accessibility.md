# Microsoft Active Accessibility

## Purpose

Microsoft Active Accessibility is a Component Object Model (COM)-based technology that improves the way accessibility aids work with applications running on Microsoft Windows. It provides dynamic-link libraries that are incorporated into the operating system as well as a COM interface and API elements that provide reliable methods for exposing information about UI elements.

## Where applicable

By using Microsoft Active Accessibility and following accessible design practices, developers can make applications running on Windows more accessible to many people with vision, hearing, or motion disabilities.

## Developer audience

Microsoft Active Accessibility is designed primarily for C, C++, and Microsoft Visual Basic developers. In general, developers need a moderate level of understanding about COM objects and interfaces as well as about Unicode.

## Run-time requirements

Full support for Microsoft Active Accessibility is built into Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Microsoft Active Accessibility is also supported on Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 6 (SP6) and later, and Windows 98.
