# Dynamic Annotation

Dynamic annotation was previously available only to Microsoft Active Accessibility servers and clients. Now the technique is available to all UI Automation clients, as well as some MSAA server and UI Automation provider implementations. Also, annotations made to custom controls using dynamic annotation (all three techniques) are accessible to UI Automation clients.

For more information, see [Dynamic Annotation API](dynamic-annotation-api.md).
