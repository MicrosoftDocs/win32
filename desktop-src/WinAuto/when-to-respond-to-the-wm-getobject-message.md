# When to Respond to the WM\_GETOBJECT Message

If an application supports Microsoft Active Accessibility or UI Automation for a UI element, the application must not respond to the [**WM\_GETOBJECT**](wm-getobject.md) message before the object that represents the UI element is fully initialized, or after the application has begun to close. When an application creates a new window, the system raises the [**EVENT\_OBJECT\_CREATE**](event-constants.md) WinEvent to notify clients before sending the [**WM\_CREATE**](/windows/desktop/winmsg/wm-create) message to the application's window procedure. Because many applications use **WM\_CREATE** to start the initialization process, any accessibility implementation of a UI element does not respond to the [**WM\_GETOBJECT**](wm-getobject.md) message until after the application has finished processing the **WM\_CREATE** message.
