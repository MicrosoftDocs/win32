# Getting started with DirectX Graphics

Microsoft DirectX graphics provides a set of APIs that you can use to create games and other high-performance multimedia applications. DirectX graphics includes support for high-performance 2-D and 3-D graphics.

For 3-D graphics, use the Microsoft Direct3D 11 API. Even if you have Microsoft Direct3D 9-level or Microsoft Direct3D 10-level hardware, you can use the Direct3D 11 API and target a [feature level](/windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-downlevel-intro) 9\_x or feature level 10\_x device. For info about how to develop 3-D graphics with DirectX, see [Create 3D graphics with DirectX](/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh465137(v=win.10)
).

For 2-D graphics and text, use Direct2D and [DirectWrite](./directwrite/direct-write-portal.md) rather than Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI).

To compose bitmaps that Direct3D 11 or Direct2D populated, use [DirectComposition](./directcomp/directcomposition-portal.md).

To learn about how to create a Windows Store app that uses DirectX, see [Create your first Windows Store app using DirectX](/previous-versions/windows/apps/br229580(v=win.10)
). You can use the [**Windows.UI::Xaml::Controls::SwapChainPanel**](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.SwapChainPanel) class to create high-performance DirectX apps with a XAML UI overlay. For more info about combining XAML and DirectX in a Windows app, see [DirectX and XAML interop](/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh825871(v=win.10)).

To learn about how to build a display driver for Windows 8, see [Roadmap for the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM)](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/roadmap-for-developing-drivers-for-the-windows-vista-display-driver-mo).

If you need the documentation for previous DirectX versions, see [Classic DirectX Graphics](/windows/desktop/classic-directx-graphics).
