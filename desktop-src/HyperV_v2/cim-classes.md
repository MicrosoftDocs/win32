# CIM Classes (Hyper-V management)

The CIM classes are base classes that all WMI objects derive from. Each provider potentially may use a slightly different versions of the CIM classes; therefore, most v2 WMI providers contain their own CIM class documentation.

The following CIM classes are found in the root\\virtualization\\v2 namespace.
