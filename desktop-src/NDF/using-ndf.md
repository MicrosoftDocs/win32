# Using NDF

The Network Diagnostics Framework (NDF) ships as part of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and later. NDF can be used by software developers to diagnose and repair network issues that may be causing their applications to fail. Developers can use Microsoft-provided APIs that connect their applications to NDF. In some cases, developers can also build NDF helper class extensions to help diagnose issues specific to their networking software.
