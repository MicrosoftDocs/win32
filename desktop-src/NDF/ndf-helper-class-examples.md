# NDF Helper Class Extension Examples

These examples apply only when developers believe it is necessary to extend the functionality of a Microsoft NDF Helper Class that is declared to be extensible. This is generally not necessary, but in some cases, unique diagnostic opportunities present themselves because of the specific hardware or software requirements of the component.

The two examples that follow are related and the first should be understood before analyzing the second. The first provides an implementation of an [NDF Helper Class Extension](ndf-helper-class-example.md) using a class called SimpleHelperFileClass.

The second, [NDF Helper Class Extension with Handoff](ndf-helper-class-example-with-handoff.md), provides an example of an extension that does not perform specific diagnostic tasks but only generates a low health hypothesis for the SimpleHelperFileClass in the first example.
