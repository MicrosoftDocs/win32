# Network Diagnostics Framework

## Purpose

The Network Diagnostics Framework (NDF) provides a way for component and application developers to simplify network troubleshooting for users. Users can attempt to diagnose and repair a network problem using a single troubleshooting tool.

Microsoft provides NDF helper classes, some of which are extensible so that developers can create troubleshooting units called helper class extensions to provide more detailed diagnoses specific to particular software or hardware components.

## Where applicable

NDF can be used by any vendor's software which relies on network connectivity.

## Developer audience

The NDF API is designed for C/C++ developers.

## Run-time requirements

NDF is available for computers running Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, or later.
