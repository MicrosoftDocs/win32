# Dictionaries

Dictionaries allow tokenization of common node data such as element / attribute names, namespaces and common text within a binary XML format.


A [**Dictionary>**](/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/ns-webservices-ws_xml_dictionary) can be specified as part of the [**WS\_XML\_STRING**](/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/ns-webservices-ws_xml_string) type. All strings within a single **Dictionary>** must be unique.

Dictionary ID's are supported for all encodings (not just the binary XML format).

The following function is used with dictionaries:

-   [**WsGetDictionary**](/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/nf-webservices-wsgetdictionary)
