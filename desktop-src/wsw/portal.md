# Windows Web Services API

## Purpose

WWSAPI is a native-code implementation of SOAP which provides core network communication functionality by supporting a set of the WS-\* and .NET-\* family of protocols. WWSAPI is designed to be used by components/applications which fall into one of the following categories:

-   Native code mandate
-   Require minimal dependencies
-   Require minimal startup time
-   Memory constrained environments

## Developer audience

Windows Web Services API (WWSAPI) offers C/C++ application programming interface (API) for building SOAP based web services and clients to them. A basic understanding of web services and protocol associated with them is important to use this API.

## Run-time requirements

Windows Web Services API (WWSAPI) is an operating-system component of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 or later versions of Microsoft Windows.
