# XML Layer Overview

The XML API in WWSAPI is based on the [XML Reader](xml-reader.md) and [XML Writer](xml-writer.md) objects, which allow reading or writing of XML documents in a forward only fashion. The XML Layer give the application full access to and control over the content of messages.

## Encoding

The XML API supports documents encoded as:

-   Text (UTF-8, UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE)
-   Binary
-   MTOM

## Storage

The XML API supports processing documents stored as:

-   An in-memory buffer of encoded bytes
-   A stream
-   An [XML Buffer](xml-buffer.md)

An [XML Buffer](xml-buffer.md) is a structured in-memory representation of an XML document. This is a more efficient representation than a document encoded as bytes. An XML document stored in an An XML Buffer can be navigated, read, or written.

## I/O

The XML API will never perform I/O unless specifically requested. Furthermore, any I/O may be initiated in an asynchronous fashion. See [**WsFillReader**](/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/nf-webservices-wsfillreader) and [**WsFlushWriter**](/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/nf-webservices-wsflushwriter) for details on asynchronous processing with the XML API.

## Processing

The XML API has three distinct levels at which the document may be processed.

A document may be processed a [**node**](/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/ns-webservices-ws_xml_node) at a time. This offers the most fine-grained handling of the XML content, and provides complete fidelity of data from the document. At this level, the functions [**WsReadNode**](/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/nf-webservices-wsreadnode) and [**WsWriteNode**](/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/nf-webservices-wswritenode) and [**WsCopyNode**](/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/nf-webservices-wscopynode) would be used.

The next level of control are APIs like [**WsReadStartElement**](/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/nf-webservices-wsreadstartelement), [**WsReadValue**](/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/nf-webservices-wsreadvalue) and [**WsReadEndElement**](/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/nf-webservices-wsreadendelement). These APIs provide numerous kinds of validation, skip whitespace and comments, and normalize text and CDATA to present the consumer with a simpler view of the xml.

The highest level of control is to use the Serialization API. These APIs are driven off a mapping between C data types and XML, and can read or write a complex in-memory structure to xml and back with a single function like [**WsWriteElement**](/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/nf-webservices-wswriteelement) and [**WsReadElement**](/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/nf-webservices-wsreadelement).

The XML Canonicalization APIs may be used to generate a canonical form of XML which may in turn be used for generating cryptographic signatures over XML content.

## Creating a writer

To create and use a writer to write to an in-memory buffer:

``` syntax
WsCreateWriter              // Create an instance of a WS_XML_WRITER
// Initialize a WS_XML_WRITER_BUFFER_OUTPUT
WsSetOutput                 // Set the encoding and output of the writer along with any other writer properties
// Write Elements
WsGetWriterProperty(..., WS_XML_WRITER_PROPERTY_BYTES, ...)  // Get the generated bytes as a single byte array
// Use the generated bytes
WsFreeWriter                // Free the writer
```

To create and use a writer to write to a stream:

``` syntax
WsCreateWriter              // Create an instance of a WS_XML_WRITER
// Initialize a WS_XML_WRITER_STREAM_OUTPUT
WsSetOutput                 // Set the encoding and output of the writer along with any other writer properties
// Write Elements
WsFlushWriter               // Force any buffered data to be written
WsFreeWriter                // Free the writer
```

To create and use a writer to write to a [WS\_XML\_BUFFER](ws-xml-buffer.md):

``` syntax
WsCreateXmlBuffer           // Create the buffer to write to
WsCreateWriter              // Create an instance of a WS_XML_WRITER
WsSetOutputToBuffer         // Set the output buffer along with any other writer properties
// Write Elements
WsFreeWriter                // Free the writer
// The buffer has the generated document
```

In all cases, the property [**WS\_XML\_WRITER\_PROPERTY\_INDENT**](/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/ne-webservices-ws_xml_writer_property_id) may be included to format the xml.

## Writing Elements

To write an element to a writer:

``` syntax
WsWriteStartElement          // Write a start element
for each attribute
{
// Write an attribute using either
WsWriteStartAttribute    // Write a start attribute
// Write Content
WsWriteEndAttribute      // Write an end attribute
// Or one of the following
WsWriteXmlnsAttribute    // Write an explicit xmlns attribute
}
// Write Elements or Content
WsWriteEndElement
```

The following may also be used:

``` syntax
WsWriteArray                 // Write an array of primitive values as a series of repeated elements
```

## Writing Content

To write content to an element or attribute, the following may be used:

``` syntax
WsWriteChars                 // Write unicode characters from memory
WsWriteCharsUtf8             // Write UTF-8 encoded characters from memory
WsWriteBytes                 // Write binary data encoded as base64
WsPushBytes                  // Direct the writer to request that bytes be written
WsPullBytes                  // Direct the writer to read the bytes to be written
WsWriteValue                 // Write primitive values such as ints and BOOLs
WsWriteText                  // Write an WS_XML_TEXT
WsWriteQualifiedName         // Write a qualified name
```

The following can be used to write to a document, but may not be used when within an attribute.

``` syntax
WsWriteNode                  // Write a single WS_XML_NODE
WsCopyNode                   // Copy a single node, or an entire WS_XML_ELEMENT_NODE and children from an WS_XML_READER
```

The following may be used to write a CDATA section in a text document:

``` syntax
WsWriteStartCData            // Start a CDATA section in a text encoding
// Write Content
WsWriteEndCData              // End a CDATA section in text encoding
```

## Miscellaneous

``` syntax
WsGetPrefixFromNamespace     // Find a prefix bound to a namespace
```

## Creating a reader

To create and use a reader to read from an in-memory buffer:

``` syntax
WsCreateReader              // Create an instance of a WS_XML_READER
// Initialize a WS_XML_READER_BUFFER_INPUT
WsSetInput                  // Set the encoding and input of the reader along with any other reader properties
// Read Elements
WsFreeReader                // Free the reader
```

To create and use a reader to reader from a stream:

``` syntax
WsCreateReader              // Create an instance of a WS_XML_READER
// Initialize a WS_XML_READER_STREAM_INPUT
WsSetInput                  // Set the encoding and input of the reader along with any other reader properties
WsFillReader                // Populate the reader with data from the underlying stream
// Read Elements
WsFreeReader                // Free the reader
```

To create and use a reader to read from a [WS\_XML\_BUFFER](ws-xml-buffer.md):

``` syntax
WsCreateXmlBuffer           // Create the buffer to write to
WsCreateReader              // Create an instance of a WS_XML_READER
WsSetInputToBuffer          // Set the input buffer along with any other reader properties
// Read Elements
WsFreeReader                // Free the reader
```

## Reading Elements

To read an element from a reader:

``` syntax
WsReadToStartElement         // Skip whitespace and comments to position the reader on a specific element
for each attribute of interest
{
WsFindAttribute          // Try Locate the attribute
if (found)
{
WsReadStartAttribute // Set the reader to read the attribute
// Read Content
WsReadEndAttribute   // Return the reader to the element
}
}
WsReadStartElement           // Advance the reader past the current element
// Read Elements or Content
WsWriteEndElement            // Advance the reader past the corresponding end element
```

The following may also be used:

``` syntax
WsReadArray                  // Read an array of primitive values as a series of repeated elements
```

## Reading Content

To read content from an element or attribute, the following may be used:

``` syntax
WsReadChars                 // Read characters to memory as unicode
WsReadCharsUtf8             // Read characters to memory encoded as UTF-8
WsReadBytes                 // Read binary data encoded as base64
WsReadValue                 // Read primitive values such as ints and BOOLs
WsReadQualifiedName         // Read a qualified name
```

The following may be used to inspect the current node the reader is positioned on:

``` syntax
WsGetReaderNode             // Get the current node
```

## Using a buffer

When writing to a [WS\_XML\_BUFFER](ws-xml-buffer.md) the following may be used:

``` syntax
WsGetWriterPosition          // Get the current position of the writer in the document
WsSetWriterPosition          // Set the current position of the writer in the document
WsMoveWriter                 // Move relative to the current position in the document
WsRemoveNode                 // Delete an element or text from a document
```

When reading from a [WS\_XML\_BUFFER](ws-xml-buffer.md) the following may be used:

``` syntax
WsGetReaderPosition          // Get the current position of the reader in the document
WsSetReaderPosition          // Set the current position of the reader in the document
WsMoveReader                 // Move relative to the current position in the document
```

The following may be used to modify a [WS\_XML\_BUFFER](ws-xml-buffer.md):

``` syntax

WsRemoveNode                 // Delete an element or text from a document
```

## Other

``` syntax
WsGetNamespaceFromPrefix     // Find a namespace bound to a prefix
WsGetXmlAttribute            // Find an "xml:space" or "xml:lang" attribute in scope
```
