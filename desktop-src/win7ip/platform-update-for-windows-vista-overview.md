### Windows Automation API

Windows Automation API 3.0 is a set of DLLs and API elements that enable Assistive Technology (AT) products to provide better computer access for individuals who have physical or cognitive difficulties, impairments, or disabilities. Additionally, because Windows Automation API 3.0 enables applications to access and manipulate the user interface (UI) elements of other applications, it is an ideal technology for implementing automated testing tools.

Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) and UI Automation are similar in that both provide a means for exposing and collecting information about user interface elements and controls to support user interface accessibility and software test automation. UI Automation is a Windows implementation of the UI Automation specification. It is a newer technology that addresses many of the limitations of MSAA.

For more information about the Windows Automation API 3.0, see [Windows Automation API: Overview](/windows/desktop/WinAuto/windows-automation-api-overview).

The Platform Update for Windows Vista and the Platform Update for Windows Server 2008 support the following Windows Automation API 3.0:

-   [Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA)](#microsoft-active-accessibility-msaa)
