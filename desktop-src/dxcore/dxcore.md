# DXCore

DXCore is an adapter enumeration API for graphics and compute devices, so some of its facilities overlap with those of [DXGI](../direct3ddxgi/dx-graphics-dxgi.md). DXCore is used by Direct3D 12.

This documentation set contains information about programming with DXCore, as well as the DXCore reference.
