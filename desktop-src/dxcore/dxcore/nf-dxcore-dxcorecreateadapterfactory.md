# DXCoreCreateAdapterFactory function

## Description

Creates a DXCore adapter factory, which you can use to generate further DXCore objects. For programming guidance, and code examples, see [Using DXCore to enumerate adapters](../dxcore-enum-adapters.md).

## Parameters

### riid

Type: **REFIID**

A reference to the globally unique identifier (GUID) of the interface that you wish to be returned in *ppvFactory*. This is expected to be the interface identifier (IID) of [IDXCoreAdapterFactory](../dxcore_interface/nn-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapterfactory.md).

### ppvFactory [out]

Type: **void\*\***

The address of a pointer to an interface with the IID specified in the *riid* parameter. Upon successful return, *\*ppvFactory* (the dereferenced address) contains a pointer to the DXCore factory created.

## Returns

Type: **[HRESULT](../../com/structure-of-com-error-codes.md)**

If the function succeeds, it returns **S_OK**. Otherwise, it returns an [**HRESULT**](../../com/structure-of-com-error-codes.md) [error code](../../com/com-error-codes-10.md).

|Return value|Description|
|-|-|
|E_NOINTERFACE|An invalid value was provided for *riid*.|
|E_POINTER|`nullptr` was provided for *ppvFactory*.|

## Remarks

For the duration of time that a reference exists on an [IDXCoreAdapterFactory](../dxcore_interface/nn-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapterfactory.md) interface, an [IDXCoreAdapterList](../dxcore_interface/nn-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapterlist.md) interface, or an [IDXCoreAdapter](../dxcore_interface/nn-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter.md) interface, additional calls to **DXCoreCreateAdapterFactory**, [IDXCoreAdapterList::GetFactory](../dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapterlist-getfactory.md), or [IDXCoreAdapter::GetFactory](../dxcore_interface/nf-dxcore_interface-idxcoreadapter-getfactory.md) will return pointers to the same object, increasing the reference count of the **IDXCoreAdapterFactory** interface.
