# Basic Color Management Concepts

To understand how Windows Color Systemn (WCS) version 1.0 is used, a working knowledge of color management concepts is required. This overview presents enough color management background to provide a definition of the color management terms and concepts that appear in the WCS Programmer's Reference in the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) documentation. It is not exhaustive in its coverage. The topics in this section cover the major areas of color management, such as:

-   [Color in Imaging](color-in-imaging.md)
-   [Color Spaces](color-spaces.md)
-   [Color Conversion and Color Matching](color-conversion-and-color-matching.md)
-   [Windows Color System Schemas and Algorithms](windows-color-system-schemas-and-algorithms.md)

-   [Further Information](further-information.md)
