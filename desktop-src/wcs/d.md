# D

## DAC

Digital to analog converter.

## device link profile

A file that contains a concatenation of color conversions that are used often.

## device profile

A file that contains information on how to characterize the color capabilites of a device. ICC device profiles convert colors from the gamut of a device into the PCS. It also holds the information necessary for conversion of colors from the PCS into the device's gamut. WCS XML device profiles provide the measurement data and algorithmic references to convert between the native device space and CIEXYZ.

## DMP

The Color Device Model Profile Format is an XML-based file format that contains measurements required to describe the relationship between native device color space values and CIEXYZ values.
