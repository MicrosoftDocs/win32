## gamma correction

The native physical tone characteristics of a device are often different on different types of devices. The gamma correction factor compensates for these differences.

## gamma curve

A collection of gamma corrections over the entire range of colors. When plotted on a graph, they form a curve.

## gamma ramp

See gamma curve.

## gamut

The set of colors from a color space that a device can produce.

## GMMP

The Color Gamut Map Model Profile Format is an XML-based file format that controls the mapping of colors between source and destination device gamuts.
