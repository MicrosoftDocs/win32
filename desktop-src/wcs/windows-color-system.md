# Windows Color System

## Purpose

Color management schemes are implemented in Microsoft Windows operating systems to improve the rendering of color content in all forms of digital communication.

The color management scheme that's used starting with Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 is called Image Color Management (ICM) 2.0. The color management scheme that's used starting with Windows Vista is called Windows Color System (WCS) 1.0. The WCS 1.0 color management scheme is a superset of ICM 2.0 APIs and functionality.

## Where applicable

ICM can be used in all applications on Windows 2000 and later operating systems. WCS can be used in all applications on Windows Vista and later operating systems.

## Developer audience

The WCS API is designed for use by C/C++ programmers. Familiarity with the Windows graphical user interface, message-driven architecture, and a working knowledge of color management concepts are required.

## Run-time requirements

Applications that use the ICM API require Windows 2000 or later. Applications that use the WCS API require Windows Vista or later. For specific run-time information on a function, see the Requirements section of the reference page for that function.
