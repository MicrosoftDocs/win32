# Responsibilities and Features

Each part of the interactive logon process has a set of responsibilities. This section defines those responsibilities and indicates where you can implement features not contained in the standard version of the operating system.

This section also describes the optional features of MSGina.dll. If you are developing a replacement [*GINA*](../secgloss/g-gly.md) DLL, you may want to implement some or all of these features as well.
