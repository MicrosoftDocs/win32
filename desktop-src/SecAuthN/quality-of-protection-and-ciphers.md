# Quality of Protection and Ciphers

The quality of protection determines the level of security that is used when sending and receiving messages. Microsoft Digest selects a level based on the requirements of the client and server.

When using Digest as a SASL mechanism, applications can specify that messages be kept confidential using encryption. The server specifies the ciphers it supports for encrypted messages, and the client selects a cipher from this list.

The following topics discuss these security mechanisms in detail:

-   [Quality of Protection](quality-of-protection.md)
-   [Ciphers](ciphers.md)
