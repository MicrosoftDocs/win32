# Sample SSPI Code

This section includes two complete examples:

-   [Using SSPI with a Windows Sockets Client](using-sspi-with-a-windows-sockets-client.md)
-   [Using SSPI with a Windows Sockets Server](using-sspi-with-a-windows-sockets-server.md)

The client and server examples are designed to work together. Both examples use the header file Security.h which can be found in [Header File for SSPI Client and Server Samples](header-file-for-sspi-client-and-server.md).

For an example of how to initialize an array of security buffers, see [SecBuffer and SecBufferDesc Example Code](secbuffer-and-secbufferdesc-example-code.md).

For information about signing or encrypting data once a secure connection has been established, see [Using Message Support](using-message-support.md).
