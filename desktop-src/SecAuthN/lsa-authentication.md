# LSA Authentication

LSA Authentication describes the parts of the [*Local Security Authority*](../secgloss/l-gly.md) (LSA) that applications can use to authenticate and log users on to the local system. It also describes how to create and call authentication packages and security packages.

The LSA Authentication functions let you write an authentication package, a subauthentication package, or a combined security support provider/authentication package (SSP/AP).

The following topics provide more information about LSA Authentication:

-   [LSA Authentication Model](lsa-authentication-model.md)
-   [LSA Logon Sessions](lsa-logon-sessions.md)
-   [LSA User Logon Authentication](lsa-user-logon-authentication.md)
-   [Authentication Packages](authentication-packages.md)

For information about the LSA Authentication functions, see [Authentication Reference](authentication-reference.md).

For information about related technologies, see [LSA Policy](../secmgmt/lsa-policy.md) and [Winlogon and Credential Providers](winlogon-and-credential-providers.md).
