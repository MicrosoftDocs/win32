Secure Channel, also known as [*Schannel*](../secgloss/s-gly.md), is a [*security support provider*](../secgloss/s-gly.md) (SSP) that contains a set of security protocols that provide identity authentication and secure, private communication through encryption.

Schannel is primarily used for Internet applications that require secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) communications.
