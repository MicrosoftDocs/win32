# Microsoft Digest SSP

Microsoft Digest is a [*security support provider*](../secgloss/s-gly.md) (SSP) that implements the Digest Access protocol, a lightweight authentication protocol for parties involved in Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Simple Authentication Security Layer (SASL) based communications.

Microsoft Digest provides a simple challenge response mechanism for authenticating clients. This SSP is intended for use by client/server applications using HTTP or SASL based communications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Digest authentication is not supported across forests.
