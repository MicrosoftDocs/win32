# Contents of a Digest Challenge

The size of a Digest Access challenge must be less than 2048 bytes. The following example shows a challenge assigned to the character string szChallenge.


```C++
szChallenge = "realm=\"Microsoft_Example_Forest\",";
algorithm = "MD5-sess\", qop=\"auth\", nonce=\"0123456789abcdef\"";
```



> [!Note]  
> The challenge string is enclosed in double quotes and contains embedded double quotes. Embedded double quotes must be preceded (escaped) with a backslash (\\).

 

A Digest challenge can contain the following directives.



| Directive         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| realm             | An implementation-defined hint to the client about which [*credentials*](/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly) are required. The client should display this information to the user if it is prompting for credentials.                                                  |
| algorithm         | Microsoft Digest supports MD5 and MD5-Sess. For optimal performance, use MD5-Sess.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| qop               | This directive can be set to auth, auth-int, or auth-conf. For more information, see [Quality of Protection and Ciphers](quality-of-protection-and-ciphers.md).                                                                                                                                       |
| nonce             | A unique encoded value generated by the server for each challenge. This value must not be altered by the client.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| opaque            | Contains a reference for the [*security context*](/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly) that is being established. For more information, see [Maintaining the Security Context Between Connections](maintaining-the-security-context-between-connections.md). |
| cipher(SASL only) | The list of ciphers that the server supports. This element can be present in a Digest SASL challenge only if the qop directive specifies auth-conf. For more information, see [Quality of Protection and Ciphers](quality-of-protection-and-ciphers.md).                                              |
| charset           | This directive can be set to utf-8 if the server can process UTF-8–encoded user names and realms. If the client understands the charset directive, it can respond by using UTF-8–encoded values.                                                                                                       |



 

Microsoft Digest generates the Digest challenge string for server applications. For details, see [Generating the Digest Challenge](generating-the-digest-challenge.md).
