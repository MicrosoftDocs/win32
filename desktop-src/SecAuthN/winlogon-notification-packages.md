# Winlogon Notification Packages

[*Winlogon*](../secgloss/w-gly.md) notification packages are DLLs that receive and handle events generated by Winlogon. You can implement such a notification package to monitor and respond to Winlogon events. This is useful for applications that need to perform additional processing during logon or logoff, or maintain [*state*](../secgloss/s-gly.md) information that must be updated when Winlogon events occur.

For more information about Winlogon and GINAs, see [Winlogon and GINA](winlogon-and-gina.md).
