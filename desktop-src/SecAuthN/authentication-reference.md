# Authentication Reference

Authentication reference pages contain detailed descriptions of the Microsoft authentication functions, interfaces, objects, structures, and other programming elements. These topics provide information about the programming elements used to establish the identity of users and services. After an identity is established, it can be used to attempt access to a single computer or to the resources on a computer network.

Reference pages are divided into the following groups.



| Section                                                          | Description                                                                          |
