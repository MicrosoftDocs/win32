# Winlogon Notification Package Reference

The following topics provide reference information for [*Winlogon*](../secgloss/w-gly.md) notification packages:

-   [Registry Entries](registry-entries.md) lists the key values and settings that must be entered in the system registry in order to register a notification package and its event handler functions.
-   [Event Handler Function Prototype](event-handler-function-prototype.md) details the prototype for event handler functions. Each event handler function in your notification package must match this prototype.
