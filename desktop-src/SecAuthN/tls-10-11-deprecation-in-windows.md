# TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 deprecation in Windows

The internet standards and regulatory bodies have deprecated or disallowed TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 due to several security issues. Starting with Windows 11 Insider Preview releases in 2024, they will be disabled by default. This change applies to both server and client devices but won't impact in-market Operating System versions.

TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 have already been disabled by Microsoft 365 products as well as WinHTTP and WinINet API surfaces. Most newer versions of applications support TLS 1.2 or higher protocol versions. Therefore, if an application starts failing after this change, the first step is to look for a newer version of the application that has TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 support.

To learn more about this deprecation, see [RFC 8996](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8996.html).

## Re-enabling TLS 1.0 and 1.1

> [!CAUTION]
> Directly editing the registry isn't recommended unless there is no other alternative. Modifications to the registry are not validated by the Registry Editor or by the Windows operating system before they are applied. As a result, incorrect values can be stored, and this can result in unrecoverable errors in the system. When possible, instead of editing the registry directly, use Group Policy or other Windows tools such as the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). If you must edit the registry, use extreme caution.

The following **DWORD** registry values can be created to enable TLS 1.0 and 1.1 versions system-wide:

```registry
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.0\Client\Enabled
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.1\Client\Enabled
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.0\Server\Enabled
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.1\Server\Enabled
```

Setting these **DWORD** values to **1** enables TLS 1.0 and 1.1 for TLS clients and servers. To revert these changes, delete the above registry values.

The following Powershell script can be used to re-enable TLS 1.0 and 1.1:

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.0\Client" -Name "Enabled" -Value 1 -Type DWord

Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.1\Client" -Name "Enabled" -Value 1 -Type DWord

Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.0\Server" -Name "Enabled" -Value 1 -Type DWord

Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.1\Server" -Name "Enabled" -Value 1 -Type DWord
```

To learn more about TLS registry settings, see [Transport Layer Security (TLS) registry settings](/windows-server/security/tls/tls-registry-settings).

> [!NOTE]
> Support for legacy TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 may be removed completely in the future.

## Known issues

The following Windows applications rely on TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1 and are expected to fail or lose some functionality. The provided list is not exhaustive. If other applications show issues, we recommend checking with the software vendor for an updated version.
