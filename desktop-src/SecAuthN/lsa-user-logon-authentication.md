# LSA User Logon Authentication

The LSA handles user logon and authentication on the local computer, and if the authentication package processing the logon request supports pass-through authentication, the LSA can also log users on to other computers on the network. The LSA provides access to authentication packages for Security Support Providers (SSPs). One of the two following types of authentication is performed:

-   [Interactive Authentication](interactive-authentication.md)
-   [Noninteractive Authentication](noninteractive-authentication.md)
