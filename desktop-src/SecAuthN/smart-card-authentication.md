# Smart Card Authentication

The basic parts of the [*smart card subsystem*](../secgloss/s-gly.md) are based on PC/SC standards (see the specifications at [https://pcscworkgroup.com](https://pcscworkgroup.com)). These basic parts include:

-   A [*resource manager*](../secgloss/r-gly.md) that uses a Windows API.
-   A [*user interface*](../secgloss/u-gly.md) (UI) that works with the resource manager.
-   Several base [*service providers*](../secgloss/s-gly.md) that provide access to specific services. In contrast to the resource manager's Windows API, service providers use a COM interface model to provide [*smart card*](../secgloss/s-gly.md) services.

The following illustration shows the relationships of these parts in the overall smart card architecture.

For information about how the [*smart card subsystem*](../secgloss/s-gly.md) works with other services available in the Microsoft Internet Security Framework, see [Relation to Other Services](relation-to-other-services.md).
