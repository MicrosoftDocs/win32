# Relation to Other Services

Other parts of the Microsoft Internet Security Framework use the [*smart card subsystem*](../secgloss/s-gly.md), as shown in the following illustration. (Because of U.S. export restrictions, a [*cryptographic service provider*](../secgloss/c-gly.md) (CSP) that uses an SCSP to communicate cryptographic-related requests should sign and verify the SCSP.)
