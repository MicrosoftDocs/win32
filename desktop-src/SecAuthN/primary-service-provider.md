# Primary Service Provider

Each [*smart card*](../secgloss/s-gly.md) known to the system may have a registered COM interface listed as its primary service provider. When you access a *smart card* through COM, this [*primary service provider*](../secgloss/p-gly.md) supplies the control interfaces to the card. This allows card services to be exposed to a wide range of programming environments, including Java and the Microsoft Visual Basic development system.
