# Authentication (Authentication)

## Purpose

Authentication is the process by which the system validates a user's logon information. A user's name and password are compared to an authorized list, and if the system detects a match, access is granted to the extent specified in the permission list for that user.

Microsoft authentication technologies include LSA Authentication, Credentials Management, Smart Card Authentication, Network Provider, Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI), Winlogon, and GINA.

## Developer audience

Microsoft authentication technologies are intended for use by developers of applications that are based on the Windows Server, Windows Vista, and Windows operating systems that authenticate clients. Developers should be familiar with Windows-based programming. Although not required, an understanding of authentication or security-related subjects is advised.

## Run-time requirements
