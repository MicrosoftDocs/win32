# Tutorial for authenticating web pages

This tutorial highlights the different aspects that web developers should care about when designing pages for the web authorization flow for Windows 8. This section This sample demonstrates a two-page authorization flow.

**Objective:** The goal of the sample is not to be prescriptive about the layout or visual design that each provider will certainly have a unique point of view on, but to call out a few areas worth investing in to have a first-class Microsoft design style experience for Windows 8.

## Prerequisites

In order to use web authentication broker APIs, you need:

-   Windows 8 (x86 or amd64 only)
-   Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) should be installed from the Control Panel under "Programs and Features" and using the "Turn Windows features on or off" option.

**Total time to complete:** 2 minutes.
