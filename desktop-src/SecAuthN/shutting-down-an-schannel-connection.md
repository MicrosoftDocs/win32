# Shutting Down an Schannel Connection

When a client or server is finished with a connection, it must shut it down. The other party, in turn, must recognize the shutdown and delete the connection.

**To shut down an Schannel connection**

1.  Call the [**ApplyControlToken**](applycontroltoken.md) function, specifying the SCHANNEL\_SHUTDOWN control token.
2.  After receiving an SEC\_E\_OK return value from [**ApplyControlToken**](applycontroltoken.md), call the [**InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel)**](initializesecuritycontext--schannel-.md) (clients) or [**AcceptSecurityContext (Schannel)**](acceptsecuritycontext--schannel-.md) (servers) function, passing in empty buffers.
3.  Proceed as though your application were creating a new connection until the function returns SEC\_I\_CONTEXT\_EXPIRED or SEC\_E\_OK to indicate that the connection is shut down.
4.  Send the final output information, if any, to the remote party.
5.  Call [**DeleteSecurityContext**](deletesecuritycontext.md) to free resources held by the connection.

## Recognizing a Shutdown

The [**DecryptMessage (Schannel)**](decryptmessage--schannel-.md) function returns SEC\_I\_CONTEXT\_EXPIRED when the message sender has shut down the connection. After receiving this return value, follow the procedure To shut down an Schannel connection, earlier in this topic.
