# ISCardISO7816::ReadBinary method

\[The **ReadBinary** method is available for use in the operating systems specified in the Requirements section. It is not available for use in Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and subsequent versions of the operating system. The [Smart Card Modules](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secsmart/smart-card-modules) provide similar functionality.\]

The **ReadBinary** method constructs an [*application protocol data unit*](../secgloss/a-gly.md) (APDU) command that acquires a response message that gives that part of the contents of a transparent-structured elementary file.

## Syntax


```C++
HRESULT ReadBinary(
  [in]      BYTE       byP1,
  [in]      BYTE       byP2,
  [in]      LONG       lBytesToRead,
  [in, out] LPSCARDCMD *ppCmd
);
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*byP1* \[in\]
</dt> <dd>

The P1-P2 field, offset to the first byte to be read from the beginning of the file. If b8=1 in P1, then b7 and b6 of P1 are set to zero (RFU bits), b5 to b1 of P1 are a short EF identifier and P2 is the offset of the first byte to be read in data units from the beginning of the file. If b8=0 in P1, then P1\|\|P2 is the offset of the first byte to be read in data units from the beginning of the file.

</dd> <dt>

*byP2* \[in\]
</dt> <dd>

The P1-P2 field, offset to the first byte to be read from the beginning of the file. If b8=1 in P1, then b7 and b6 of P1 are set to zero (RFU bits), b5 to b1 of P1 are a short EF identifier and P2 is the offset of the first byte to be read in data units from the beginning of the file. If b8=0 in P1, then P1\|\|P2 is the offset of the first byte to be read in data units from the beginning of the file.

</dd> <dt>

*lBytesToRead* \[in\]
</dt> <dd>

Number of bytes to read from the transparent EF.

If the Le field contains only zeros, then within the limit of 256 for short length or 65536 for extended length, all the bytes until the end of the file should be read.

</dd> <dt>

*ppCmd* \[in, out\]
</dt> <dd>

On input, a pointer to an [**ISCardCmd**](iscardcmd.md) interface object or **NULL**.

On return, it is filled with the APDU command constructed by this operation. If *ppCmd* was set to **NULL**, a [*smart card*](../secgloss/s-gly.md) [**ISCardCmd**](iscardcmd.md) object is internally created and returned using the *ppCmd* pointer.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

The method returns one of the following possible values.



| Return code                                                                                   | Description                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| <dl> <dt>**S\_OK**</dt> </dl>          | Operation completed successfully.<br/> |
| <dl> <dt>**E\_INVALIDARG**</dt> </dl>  | Invalid parameter.<br/>                |
| <dl> <dt>**E\_POINTER**</dt> </dl>     | A bad pointer was passed in.<br/>      |
| <dl> <dt>**E\_OUTOFMEMORY**</dt> </dl> | Out of memory.<br/>                    |



 

## Remarks

The encapsulated command can only be performed if the security status of the [*smart card*](../secgloss/s-gly.md) satisfies the security attributes of the elementary file being processed.

When the command contains a valid short elementary identifier, it sets the file as current elementary file.

Elementary files without a transparent structure cannot be erased. The encapsulated command aborts if applied to an elementary file without a transparent structure.

For a list of all the methods provided by this interface, see [**ISCardISO7816**](iscardiso7816.md).

In addition to the COM error codes listed above, this interface may return a smart card error code if a smart card function was called to complete the request. For more information, see [Smart Card Return Values](authentication-return-values.md).
