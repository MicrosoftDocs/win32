# Private Communications Technology

Private Communications Technology (PCT) has been superseded by [*Secure Sockets Layer*](../secgloss/s-gly.md) 3.0 and the [Transport Layer Security Protocol](transport-layer-security-protocol.md).

Schannel supports PCT 1.0 for backward compatibility only; it should not be used for new development. PCT supports most of the cipher suites supported by SSL 2.0.
