# ID3DX10ThreadPump interface

Used to execute tasks asynchronously, and created with [**D3DX10CreateThreadPump**](d3dx10createthreadpump.md). There are several D3DX10 APIs that can optionally take a thread pump as a parameter, such as [**D3DX10CreateTextureFromFile**](d3dx10createtexturefromfile.md) and [**D3DX10CompileFromFile**](d3dx10compilefromfile.md) (see remarks for complete list). If the thread pump is passed into these APIs, they will execute asynchronously on a separate thread pump thread. The advantage to doing this is that it can make loading and processing large amounts of data happen without seeing a noticable slow down in performance on screen.

## Members

The **ID3DX10ThreadPump** interface inherits from the [**IUnknown**](/windows/win32/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown) interface. **ID3DX10ThreadPump** also has these types of members:

## Remarks

The thread pump loads and processes data in a 3 step process. It goes:

1.  Load and decompress the data with a Data Loader. The data loader object has three methods that the thread pump will call internally as it is loading and decompressing the data: [**ID3DX10DataLoader::Load**](id3dx10dataloader-load.md), [**ID3DX10DataLoader::Decompress**](id3dx10dataloader-decompress.md), and [**ID3DX10DataLoader::Destroy**](id3dx10dataloader-destroy.md). The specific functionality of these three APIs differs depending on the type of data being loaded and decompressed. The data loader interface can also be inherited and its APIs can be changed if one is loading a data file defined in one's own custom format.
2.  Process the data with a Data Processor. The data processor object has three methods that the thread pump will call internally as it is processing the data: [**ID3DX10DataProcessor::Process**](id3dx10dataprocessor-process.md), [**ID3DX10DataProcessor::CreateDeviceObject**](id3dx10dataprocessor-createdeviceobject.md), and [**ID3DX10DataProcessor::Destroy**](id3dx10dataprocessor-destroy.md). The way it processes the data will be different depending on the type of data. For example, if the data is a texture stored as a JPEG, then **ID3DX10DataProcessor::Process** will do JPEG decompression to get the image's raw image bits. If the data is a shader, then **ID3DX10DataProcessor::Process** will compile the HLSL into bytecode. After the data has been processed a device object will be created for that data (with **ID3DX10DataProcessor::CreateDeviceObject**) and the object will be added to a queue of device objects. The data processor interface can also be inherited and its APIs can be changed if one is processing a data file defined in one's own custom format.
3.  Bind the device object to the device. This is done when one's application calls [**ID3DX10ThreadPump::ProcessDeviceWorkItems**](id3dx10threadpump-processdeviceworkitems.md), which will bind a specified number of objects in the queue of device objects to the device.

The thread pump can be used to load data in one of two ways: by calling an API that takes a thread pump as a parameter, such as [**D3DX10CreateTextureFromFile**](d3dx10createtexturefromfile.md) and [**D3DX10CompileFromFile**](d3dx10compilefromfile.md), or by calling [**ID3DX10ThreadPump::AddWorkItem**](id3dx10threadpump-addworkitem.md). In the case of the APIs that take a thread pump, the data loader and data processor are created internally. In the case of **AddWorkItem**, the data loader and data processor must be created beforehand and are then passed into AddWorkItem. D3DX10 provides a set of APIs for creating data loaders and data processors that have functionality for loading and processing common data formats (see remarks for complete list of APIs). For custom data formats, the data loader and data processor interfaces must be inherited and their methods must be redefined.

The thread pump object takes up a substantial amount of resources, so generally only one should be created per application.
