# ID3DX10Sprite interface

The ID3DX10Sprite interface provides a set of methods that simplify the process of drawing sprites using Microsoft Direct3D. This interface can operate on a set of many sprites.

## Members

The **ID3DX10Sprite** interface inherits from the [**IUnknown**](/windows/win32/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown) interface. **ID3DX10Sprite** also has these types of members:

### Methods

The **ID3DX10Sprite** interface has these methods.



| Method                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| [**DrawSpritesBuffered**](id3dx10sprite-drawspritesbuffered.md)       | Add an array of sprites to the batch of sprites to be rendered. This must be called in between calls to [**ID3DX10Sprite::Begin**](id3dx10sprite-begin.md) and [**ID3DX10Sprite::End**](id3dx10sprite-end.md), and [**ID3DX10Sprite::Flush**](id3dx10sprite-flush.md) must be called before End to send all of the batched sprites to the device for rendering. This draw method is most useful when drawing a small number of sprites that you want buffered into a large batch, such as fonts.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [**DrawSpritesImmediate**](id3dx10sprite-drawspritesimmediate.md)     | Draw an array of sprites. This will immediately send the sprites to the device for rendering, which is different from [**ID3DX10Sprite::DrawSpritesBuffered**](id3dx10sprite-drawspritesbuffered.md) which only adds an array of sprites to a batch of sprites to be rendered when [**ID3DX10Sprite::Flush**](id3dx10sprite-flush.md) is called. This draw method is most useful when drawing a large number of sprites that have already been sorted on the CPU (or do not need to be sorted), such as in a particle system. This must be called in between calls to [**ID3DX10Sprite::Begin**](id3dx10sprite-begin.md) and [**ID3DX10Sprite::End**](id3dx10sprite-end.md).<br/> |
| [**End**](id3dx10sprite-end.md)                                       | Call this after ID3DX10Sprite::Flush.

| [**Flush**](id3dx10sprite-flush.md)                                   | Force all batched sprites to be submitted to the device. Device states remain as they were after the last call to ID3DX10Sprite::Begin. The list of batched sprites is then cleared.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
