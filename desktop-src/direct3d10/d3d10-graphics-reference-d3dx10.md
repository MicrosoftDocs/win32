# D3DX Reference (Direct3D 10 Graphics)

> [!NOTE]  
> The D3DX (D3DX 9, D3DX 10, and D3DX 11) utility library is deprecated for WindowsÂ 8, and is not supported for Microsoft Store apps. If upgrading to a newer version of Direct3D and associated utility code is not an option, you can make use of the [Microsoft.DXSDK.D3DX](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.DXSDK.D3DX) NuGet package rather than relying on the legacy DirectX SDK or DirectSetup.

This section contains the following sections:

-   [D3DX Interfaces](d3d10-graphics-reference-d3dx10-interfaces.md)
-   [D3DX Functions](d3d10-graphics-reference-d3dx10-functions.md)
-   [D3DX Structures](d3d10-graphics-reference-d3dx10-structures.md)
-   [D3DX Enumerations](d3d10-graphics-reference-d3dx10-enums.md)
