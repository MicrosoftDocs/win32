# ID3DX10Mesh::DrawSubsetInstanced method

Draw several instances of the same subset of a mesh.

## Syntax


```C++
HRESULT DrawSubsetInstanced(
  [in] UINT AttribId,
  [in] UINT InstanceCount,
  [in] UINT StartInstanceLocation
);
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*AttribId* \[in\]
</dt> <dd>

Type: **[**UINT**](../winprog/windows-data-types.md)**

Specifies which subset of the mesh to draw. This value is used to differentiate faces in a mesh as belonging to one or more attribute groups. See remarks.

</dd> <dt>

*InstanceCount* \[in\]
</dt> <dd>

Type: **[**UINT**](../winprog/windows-data-types.md)**

Number of instances to render.

</dd> <dt>

*StartInstanceLocation* \[in\]
</dt> <dd>

Type: **[**UINT**](../winprog/windows-data-types.md)**

Which instance to start fetching from in each buffer marked as instance data.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

Type: **[**HRESULT**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb401631(v=MSDN.10).aspx)**

The return value is one of the values listed in [Direct3D 10 Return Codes](d3d10-graphics-reference-returnvalues.md).

## Remarks

A mesh contains an attribute table. The attribute table can divide a mesh into subsets, where each subset is identified with an attribute ID. For example, a mesh with 200 faces, divided into three subsets, might have an attribute table that looks like this:



| Subset     | Faces           |
|------------|-----------------|
| AttribID 0 | Faces 0 ~ 50    |
| AttribID 1 | Faces 51 ~ 125  |
| AttribID 2 | Faces 126 ~ 200 |



 

Instancing may extend performance by reusing the same geometry to draw multiple objects in a scene. One example of instancing could be to draw the same object with different positions and colors. Indexing requires multiple vertex buffers: at least one for per-vertex data and a second buffer for per-instance data.

Drawing instances with DrawSubsetInstanced is very similar to the process used with [**ID3D10Device::DrawIndexedInstanced**](/windows/desktop/api/D3D10/nf-d3d10-id3d10device-drawindexedinstanced) that is outlined in [Instancing Sample](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Ee418269(v=VS.85).aspx). The key difference when using DrawSubsetInstanced is that vertex and index buffers must be extracted from the [**ID3DX10Mesh Interface**](id3dx10mesh.md) object before the instancing data can be combined.

The following code illustrates extracting the vertex and index buffers from the mesh object.


```
      ID3D10Buffer* vertexBuffer;
      pDeviceObj->pMesh->GetDeviceVertexBuffer(0, &vertexBuffer);
      ID3D10Buffer* indexBuffer;
      pDeviceObj->pMesh->GetDeviceIndexBuffer(&indexBuffer);
      
```
