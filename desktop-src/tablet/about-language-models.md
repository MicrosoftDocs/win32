# About Language Models

Handwriting recognizers use a defined set of rules for a given language as the primary context for recognizing words. These rules are called language models. The language model is implemented by the recognizer and cannot be directly changed by a developer using the Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition Software Development Kit (SDK). However, there are ways to refine the context for specific fields in an application. These techniques include:

-   Input scopes
-   Factoids
-   Dictionaries
-   Phrase lists
