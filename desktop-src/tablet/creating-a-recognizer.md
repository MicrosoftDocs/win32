# Creating a Recognizer

If you choose to do so, your application can provide its own recognizer implementations. This section describes the requirements for creating a custom application recognizer for your application that you can use with the Tablet PC Platform API.

> [!Note]  
> Custom application recognizers are not used by the Tablet PC Input Panel or Microsoft Windows Journal. These accessories use only recognizers with which they have been tested.

 

The following sections detail the implementation of a custom recognizer:

-   [Recognition API Architecture](recognition-api-architecture.md)
-   [Required Recognition APIs](/previous-versions//ms701664(v=vs.85))
-   [HRECOGNIZER and HRECOCONTEXT](hrecognizer-and-hrecocontext.md)
-   [Recognizer Lattice Structure](recognizer-lattice-structure.md)
-   [Registering Your Recognizer DLL](registering-your-recognizer-dll.md)
-   [Recognizer Threading Considerations](recognizer-threading-considerations.md)
-   [Typical Calling Sequence](typical-calling-sequence.md)
-   [Recognizer DLL Sample Template](recognizer-dll-sample-template.md)
-   [Unicode Range Values of Gestures](unicode-range-values-of-gestures.md)
-   [Recognizer APIs](recognizer-apis.md)
