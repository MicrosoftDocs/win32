# Exposing the Contents of a Window

An application must expose the contents of custom window classes that use Microsoft Active Accessibility. The entire window should be treated as a custom control, which is a container for other standard, customized, or custom controls.

For more information about exposing the contents of custom windows by using Active Accessibility, see the [Accessibility](/windows/desktop/accessibility) section.
