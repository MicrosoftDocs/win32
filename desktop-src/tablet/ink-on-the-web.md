# Ink on the Web

The Windows Vista Software Development Kit and Windows XP Tablet PC Edition Development Kit allow you to create ink-enabled web applications for Tablet PC users who must access remote applications. There are two basic techniques for accomplishing this: one is no-touch deployment, which allows .NET applications to be deployed from a Web or file server, and the other is to create ink-enabled Web pages with Windows Forms controls. In both cases, the ink is handled on the client, rather than the server. Note that the COM API is not supported for the Web.

To use client-side processing over the Web, you need to understand the .NET security model and how operating under partial trust affects your application. For this reason, security and trust for Tablet PC applications is discussed as well.

The following topics contain notes on various ways of creating ink-enabled Web applications.

-   [No Touch Deployment](no-touch-deployment.md)
-   [Web Controls](web-controls.md)
-   [Ink-Enabled Web Applications](ink-enabled-web-applications.md)
-   [Security and Trust](security-and-trust.md)
