# Dictionaries and Factoids

A dictionary is an internal lexicon that a recognizer uses to determine word matches and alternates. A factoid increases recognition accuracy by selecting a specific context for a particular field.

For more information about dictionaries, see [Using Application Dictionaries](using-application-dictionaries.md).

For more information about factoids, see [Using Context to Improve Accuracy](using-context-to-improve-accuracy.md).
