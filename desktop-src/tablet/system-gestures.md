# System Gestures

System gestures map to traditional mouse messages. Tablet PCs support pen system input gestures of left-click, double-click, right-click, left-drag, right-drag, and hover mouse messages. Applications developed for a Tablet PC must support these gestures in the same way that they support mouse actions. For traditional applications, many of the events triggered by gestures are interpreted as traditional mouse messages.

The following sections discuss pen and system events.
