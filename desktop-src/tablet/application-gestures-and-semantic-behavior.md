# Application Gestures and Semantic Behavior

The application gestures are delivered as part of the Windows Vista SDK. The Microsoft gesture recognizer is built to recognize these gestures. By default, no gestures are enabled. Applications must choose the gestures to enable. In addition to recognizing gestures, the Microsoft gesture recognizer also provides alternates along with confidence values as part of the recognition results. To use these gestures in your application, you must subscribe to them from within the application by using the [Tablet PC API Reference](tablet-pc-api-reference.md). The APIs enable you to choose a subset of these gestures and query for specific properties such as number of strokes, hot point, and other properties, as well as alternates and their confidence values.

For pen-aware applications that use these gestures, mouse messages are not sent. Instead, gesture events are sent to these applications informing them of these gestures. The applications then take actions that are similar to mouse-based actions in response to these gestures.

The following table lists application gestures supported by the Microsoft gesture recognizer. To ensure consistency of gestures used for common actions between applications, you should adhere to the following suggestions:

-   The Action is the suggested semantic behavior associated with the gesture.
-   For the gestures labeled as Fixed in the following table, Microsoft recommends that you not change the suggested semantic behavior. If an application does not have a need for the specified semantic behavior, Microsoft recommends that you not reuse the gesture for another action or semantic behavior.
-   For the gestures labeled as Application-specific and that have a suggested semantic behavior, Microsoft recommends you support the suggested semantic behavior if that functionality exists in your application. To maintain consistency across applications, do not choose a different semantic behavior for such a gesture if the functionality corresponding to the suggested semantic exists in your application. However, if your application does not have functionality that corresponds to the suggested semantic, you should feel free to associate relevant semantic behaviors to the gesture. This also applies to all gestures that are Application-specific and do not have a suggested semantic.
-   The hot point of a gesture is a distinguishing point in the geometry of the gesture. The hot point can be used to determine where the gesture was performed. The gestures APIs, specifically the [HotPoint](/previous-versions/ms582125(v=vs.100)) property of the [Gesture](/previous-versions/ms583661(v=vs.100)) object, make it possible to determine the hot point for a given gesture. However, not all gestures have a specific distinguishing hot point. For those that do not have a specific distinguishing hot point, the starting point is reported as the hot point.
    > [!Note]  
    > Some of the gestures do have a distinguishing hot point that just happens to be the starting point. These are distinguished in the table.

> [!Note]  
> Tap and double-tap are supported as application gestures in addition to being system gestures. This is to address scenarios where you may want to enable an application gesture that has a tap or double-tap as part of it. An example of such a gesture is the Exclamation gesture. In such a case, enable the tap application gesture and do not listen to the tap system gesture. This allows you to listen to a single component that can both identify and distinguish a tap from a tap within a gesture. The case of a tap within a gesture results in just the overall gesture being recognized.
