# Recognizer DLL Sample Template

The Recognizer DLL sample contains a template for creating a recognizer DLL. The template contains functions for registering and unregistering the server, as well as skeletons for primary recognizer functions.

This template shows how to register one CLSID in the registry. You could also do this when you install your recognizer using your setup program. Be sure you create your own unique CLSID for your languages and do not reuse the CLSID shown in the example.

By default, the samples are installed in the Samples directory under the directory to which you installed the SDK.

For an example of how to use recognizers from the Tablet PC Platform API, see the [Advanced Recognition Sample](advanced-recognition-sample.md).
