# Instantiating the PenInputPanel Class

\[[**PenInputPanel**](peninputpanel-class.md) has been replaced by [Microsoft.Ink.TextInput](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-3.5/ms581554(v=vs.90)). Please refer to the [Programming the Text Input Panel](programming-the-text-input-panel.md).\]

You can instantiate multiple [**PenInputPanel**](peninputpanel-class.md) objects, attaching one to each control on a form, or you can instantiate one **PenInputPanel** object and move it between controls in focus event handlers. Because only one edit control can have focus at a time, the second method can save memory. A version of the Auto Claims sample called the [PenInputPanel Sample](peninputpanel-sample.md) has been implemented showing both techniques.

The following sections describe creating and displaying [**PenInputPanel**](peninputpanel-class.md) objects.

-   [Creating a PenInputPanel Object](creating-a-peninputpanel-object.md)
-   [Using the PenInputPanel with Combo Boxes](using-the-peninputpanel-with-combo-boxes.md)
-   [Displaying the Input Panel](displaying-the-input-panel.md)
