# The Divider Object

Tablet PC Technology includes layout analysis of ink input that combines handwriting and drawing. The [**Divider**](inkdivider-class.md) object provides layout analysis features that classify and group strokes into different structural elements.

The [Ink Divider Sample](ink-divider-sample.md) topic demonstrates how to use a [**Divider**](inkdivider-class.md) object with [**Ink**](inkdisp-class.md) objects to perform ink layout analysis.

The following sections describe the basic concepts behind the Tablet PC layout analysis technology:

-   [Layout Analysis](layout-analysis.md)
-   [Working with the Divider Object](working-with-the-divider-object.md)
-   [Working with the DivisionResult Object](working-with-the-divisionresult-object.md)
