# Speech and Accessibility

For applications to be accessible, information about screen content must be exposed by using the voice-recognition utilities. These utilities need to identify and name specific controls so they can recognize a control name that is spoken, and manipulate that control in response to spoken commands.

For example, when using a voice input utility, a user might say "File," then say "Page Setup" to choose the corresponding command menu item, and then say "Landscape" to select the corresponding check box. You must expose the information about these elements to accomplish the desired goal.

The following topics discuss the use of speech and accessibility guidelines.
