# Ink Interoperability

Persistence and interoperability are two vitally important features, especially for applications that use ink. To enable persistence and interoperability of ink, an application must allow users to:

-   Save and open their documents with full fidelity of ink data.
-   Move data to and from other Microsoft Windows–based applications by using the Clipboard.

The following sections detail ink interoperability.

-   [Ink Data Formats](ink-data-formats.md)
-   [Important Interoperability Scenarios](important-interoperability-scenarios.md)
-   [Persistence Formats](persistence-formats.md)
-   [Choosing Which Formats to Support](choosing-which-formats-to-support.md)
-   [Building Blocks](building-blocks.md)
-   [Storing Ink in HTML](storing-ink-in-html.md)

This document assumes a detailed understanding of the Clipboard. For more information about the Clipboard, see the [Clipboard documentation](/windows/desktop/dataxchg/clipboard).
