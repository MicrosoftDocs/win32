# Tablet and Touch Samples

This section contains samples that show how applications can be developed with C\#, Microsoft Visual Basic .NET, and C++ to work with ink and touch.

By default, the samples are installed in \<system drive\>:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Tablet PC Platform SDK\\Samples\\ when installing the Tablet PC SDK.

> [!Note]  
> When installing the Windows SDK, the Windows Server SDK, or the .NET Framework SDK, the samples install in the default path for that particular SDK.
