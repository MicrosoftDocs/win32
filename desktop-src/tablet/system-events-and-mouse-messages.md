# System Events and Mouse Messages

Your application incorporates optimal design and usage of the tablet pen by sending both Microsoft Windows mouse messages and system events. Applications receive both sets of events for each pen movement or action. The application then chooses the appropriate event to use based on the context of the action. Windows mouse messages work well for pointing and selecting activities, and you should use them for activities that involve interaction with user interface (UI) elements. Pen events work well for real-time ink application, pen actions, and handwriting.

> [!Note]  
> Both pen events and mouse messages are sent to an application, regardless of whether the pen or the mouse is used.

## Distinguishing Pen Input from Mouse and Touch

When your application receives a mouse message (such as WM\_LBUTTONDOWN), it may call the [**GetMessageExtraInfo**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getmessageextrainfo) function to evaluate whether the message originated from a pen or a mouse device.

The value returned from [**GetMessageExtraInfo**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getmessageextrainfo) needs to be mask-checked against 0xFFFFFF00, and then compared with 0xFF515700. The following definitions may make this clearer:


```C++
#define MI_WP_SIGNATURE<entity type="nbsp"/> 0xFF515700
#define SIGNATURE_MASK<entity type="nbsp"/><entity type="nbsp"/> 0xFFFFFF00
#define IsPenEvent(dw)<entity type="nbsp"/><entity type="nbsp"/> (((dw) & SIGNATURE_MASK) == MI_WP_SIGNATURE
```



If the comparison is true, then this mouse message was generated by a Tablet PC pen or touch screen. In all other cases, you can assume that this message was generated by a mouse device.

The lower 8 bits returned from [**GetMessageExtraInfo**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getmessageextrainfo) are variable. Of those bits, 7 (the lower 7, masked by 0x7F) are used to represent the cursor ID, zero for the mouse or a variable value for the pen ID. Additionally, in Windows Vista, the eighth bit, masked by 0x80, is used to differentiate touch input from pen input (0 = pen, 1 = touch).

## Supported System Gestures

The following table lists system gestures currently included in Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, details the corresponding pen actions and system events, and shows how they relate to traditional mouse actions.

## Specifying Stylus and Touch Interactions

By default, your window will receive all system gesture events and use the default interaction model. Some pieces of this model may interfere with your application, so you may disable them selectively by responding to the [**WM\_TABLET\_QUERYSYSTEMGESTURESTATUS Message**](wm-tablet-querysystemgesturestatus-message.md) in your WndProc.
