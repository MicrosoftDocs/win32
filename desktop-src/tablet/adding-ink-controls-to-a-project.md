# Adding Ink Controls to a Project

To add an [InkEdit](inkedit-control-reference.md) or [InkPicture](inkpicture-control-reference.md) control to a Microsoft Visual Basic .NET or Microsoft Visual C\# project:

1.  Right-click within the Toolbox, and then click **Customize Toolbox**.
2.  In the **Customize Toolbox** dialog box, click the **.NET Framework Components** tab.
3.  In the list box, select the InkEdit and InkPicture controls, and then click **OK**. The controls are added to the Toolbox under the **Components** tab.
4.  Select the control you want from the Toolbox, and then drag the control to the place on the form where you want it to appear.

> [!Note]  
> The Tablet PC managed library can support Web controls in partially trusted environments, namely execution of managed assemblies from web pages. However, ink-enabled ActiveX controls on Web pages are not supported.
