# Getting Started (Tablet PC)

The Tablet PC is a fully functional personal computer powered by Microsoft Windows and designed for ink-enabled, pen-enabled, and speech-enabled applications. The combination of software and hardware in a Tablet PC enables these methods of user interaction creating a rich, interactive, and productive computing experience for users.

The Tablet PC platform enables input and output of handwriting and speech data on a Tablet PC as well as interchange of this data with other computers. The Tablet PC platform components installed by the Windows 7 SDK enable you to build ink-enabled and pen-enabled applications for the Tablet PC.
