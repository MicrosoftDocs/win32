# Windows Environment

> [!NOTE]
> This design guide was created for Windows 7 and has not been updated for newer versions of Windows. Much of the guidance still applies in principle, but the presentation and examples do not reflect our [current design guidance](/windows/uwp/design/).

The Windows environment is the onscreen work area provided by Windows, analogous to a physical desktop, and the operating system's core extension points. Learn how to leverage the desktop, taskbar, notification area, control panels, help, and user account control for your app.

|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Desktop](winenv-desktop.md)<br/>                | The desktop is the user's work area for their programs. It's not a way to promote awareness of your program or its brand. Don't abuse it! <br/>                                                                     |
| [Taskbar](winenv-taskbar.md)<br/>                | The taskbar is the access point for programs displayed on the desktop. With the new Windows 7 taskbar features, users can give commands, access resources, and view program status directly from the taskbar. <br/> |
| [Notification Area](winenv-notification.md)<br/> | The notification area provides notifications and status. Well-designed programs use the notification area appropriately, without being annoying or distracting. <br/>                                               |
| [Control Panels](winenv-ctrl-panels.md)<br/>     | Use control panel items to help users configure system-level features and perform related tasks. Programs that have a user interface should be configured directly from their UI instead. <br/>                     |
| [Help](winenv-help.md)<br/>                      | Use Help as a secondary mechanism to help users complete and better understand tasks the primary mechanism being the UI itself. Apply these guidelines to make the content truly helpful and easy to find. <br/>    |
| [User Account Control](winenv-uac.md)<br/>       | A well designed User Account Control experience helps prevent unwanted system-wide changes in a way that is predictable and requires minimal effort. <br/>                                                          |
