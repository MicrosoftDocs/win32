> [!NOTE]
> This design guide was created for Windows 7 and has not been updated for newer versions of Windows. Much of the guidance still applies in principle, but the presentation and examples do not reflect our [current design guidance](/windows/uwp/design/).

Use these articles to help you design the user experience for your Windows desktop apps:

-   [How to Design a Great User Experience](how-to-design-desktop-ux.md)

    Recommendations for achieving power and simplicity through carefully balanced feature selection and presentation.

-   [UX checklist](top-violations.md)

    Some common mistakes and inconsistencies to watch out for in your user interface design.
