| [User Interface Text](text-ui.md)<br/>    | User interface text appears on UI surfaces.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [Style and Tone](text-style-tone.md)<br/> | Tone in writing is the attitude that the writer conveys to the reader. It's not necessarily what you say, but how you say it. Tone is intended to create a specific response or emotion in the reader; it creates a personality that can either engage or repel users.<br/> |
