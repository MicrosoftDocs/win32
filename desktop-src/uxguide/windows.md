# Windows (Design basics)

> [!NOTE]
> This design guide was created for Windows 7 and has not been updated for newer versions of Windows. Much of the guidance still applies in principle, but the presentation and examples do not reflect our [current design guidance](/windows/uwp/design/).

Windows are the main "canvases" or UI surfaces of your desktop app, including the main windows itself and pop-ups, dialogs, and wizards. Follow these guidelines when deciding which surface to use and how best to use them.
