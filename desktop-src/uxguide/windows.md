# Windows (Design basics)

> [!NOTE]
> This design guide was created for Windows 7 and has not been updated for newer versions of Windows. Much of the guidance still applies in principle, but the presentation and examples do not reflect our [current design guidance](/windows/uwp/design/).

Windows are the main "canvases" or UI surfaces of your desktop app, including the main windows itself and pop-ups, dialogs, and wizards. Follow these guidelines when deciding which surface to use and how best to use them.

| <a href="win-window-mgt.md">Window Management</a><br /> | This article covers default placement of windows when initially displayed on the screen, their stacking order relative to other windows (<a href="glossary.md">Z order</a>), their initial size, and how their display affects input focus.<br /> | 
| <a href="win-window-frames.md">Window Frames</a><br /> | Most programs should use standard window frames. Immersive applications can have a full screen mode that hides the window frame. Consider using glass strategically for a simpler, lighter, more cohesive look. <br /> | 
| <a href="win-dialog-box.md">Dialog Boxes</a><br /> | A dialog box is a secondary window that allows users to perform a command, asks users a question, or provides users with information or progress feedback.<br /> | 
| <a href="win-common-dlg.md">Common Dialogs</a><br /> | The Microsoft Windows common dialogs consist of the Open File, Save File, Open Folder, Find and Replace, Print, Page Setup, Font, and Color dialog boxes.<br /> | 
| <a href="win-wizards.md">Wizards</a><br /> | Despite that wonderful, whimsical name, wizards are not really a special form of user interface, and they have only a particular range of utility. <br /> | 
| <a href="win-property-win.md">Property Windows</a><br /> | Property window is the collective name for the following types of user interfaces (UIs):<br /><ul><li>Property sheet: used to <strong>view and change properties for an object or collection of objects in a dialog box</strong>.</li><li>Property inspector: used to <strong>view and change properties for an object or collection of objects in a pane</strong>.</li><li>Options dialog box: used to <strong>view and change options for an application</strong>.</li></ul> |
