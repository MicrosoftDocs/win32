# Guidelines

> [!NOTE]
> This design guide was created for Windows 7 and has not been updated for newer versions of Windows. Much of the guidance still applies in principle, but the presentation and examples do not reflect our [current design guidance](/windows/uwp/design/).

These sections comprise the detailed user experience guidelines for Windows-based desktop applications.
