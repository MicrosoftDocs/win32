| [Error Messages](mess-error.md)<br/>  | An error message alerts users of a problem that has already occurred. By contrast, a warning message alerts users of a condition that might cause a problem in the future. Error messages can be presented using modal dialog boxes, in-place messages, notifications, or balloons.<br/>                                                  |
| [Warning Messages](mess-warn.md)<br/> | A warning message is a modal dialog box, in-place message, notification, or balloon that alerts the user of a condition that might cause a problem in the future.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [Confirmations](mess-confirm.md)<br/> | A confirmation is a modal dialog box that asks if the user wants to proceed with an action.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [Notifications](mess-notif.md)<br/>   | A notification informs users of events that are unrelated to the current user activity, by briefly displaying a balloon from an icon in the notification area. The notification could result from a user action or significant system event, or could offer potentially useful information from Microsoft Windows or an application.<br/> |
