| [Software Branding](exper-branding.md)<br/>   | Branding is the emotional positioning of a product as perceived by its customers. Successful branding requires skillful crafting of a product image, and is not achieved just through product logos and color schemes. <br/> |
| [Setup](exper-setup.md)<br/>                  | Users don't enjoy installing software, so modern setup experiences need to be simple, efficient, and problem-free. <br/>                                                                                                     |
| [First Experience](exper-first-exper.md)<br/> | In the ideal first experience, users install your program and use it productively immediately, without answering a bunch of questions or learning a bunch of things. <br/>                                                   |
| [Printing](exper-printing.md)<br/>            | Printing is the user experience on paper. It's easy to overlook, but it is an important part of the overall user experience. <br/>                                                                                           |
