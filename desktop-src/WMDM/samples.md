# WMDM samples

The Windows Media Device Manager SDK includes two compilable samples: a sample graphical desktop application that enables you to browse connected devices, create playlists, and drag files to and from a device; and a sample service provider that communicates with virtual "devices" on the computer (which are actually the hard drives on your computer). The documentation explains how to compile and run these projects, and also provides information about how they work.

These two projects are documented in the following sections:

-   [Sample Desktop Application](sample-desktop-application.md)
-   [Sample Service Provider](sample-service-provider.md)
