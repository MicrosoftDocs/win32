# Windows Media DRM-Implemented Interfaces

The following interfaces are not intended to be implemented by third-party service providers, but are implemented and called internally by the Windows Media DRM and Windows Media Device Manager. Implementing these interfaces will prevent DRM-protected content from being processed. They are documented merely for completeness.
