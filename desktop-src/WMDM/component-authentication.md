# Component Authentication

Every application and service provider must be authenticated before it can begin to call or implement Windows Media Device Manager methods.

Authentication is handled differently for service providers and applications. See the topic that applies to your project:

-   [Authenticating the Application](authenticating-the-application.md)
-   [Authenticating the Service Provider](authenticating-the-service-provider.md)
