| [Interfaces for Applications](interfaces-for-applications.md)                                             | Describes interfaces that are used or implemented only by desktop applications, Windows Media Player plug-ins, or COM objects that need high-level access to a portable device.                     |
| [Interfaces for Service Providers](interfaces-for-service-providers.md)                                   | Describes interfaces that are used or implemented only by service providers, which handle the actual low-level communication with a portable device.                                                |
| [Windows Media DRM-Implemented Interfaces](windows-media-drm-implemented-interfaces.md)                   | Describes interfaces that are not intended to be implemented by third-party service providers, but are implemented and called internally by the Windows Media DRM and Windows Media Device Manager. |
| [Interfaces for Service Providers and Applications](interfaces-for-service-providers-and-applications.md) | Describes interfaces that can be used either by applications or by service providers.                                                                                                               |
| [Interfaces for Secure Content Providers](interfaces-for-secure-content-providers.md)                     | Describes interfaces that must be implemented by a device or application that will use DRM-protected content.                                                                                       |
