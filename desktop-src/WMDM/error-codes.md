# Error Codes (Windows Media Device Manager 11 SDK)

Windows Media Device Manager methods can return a variety of error codes. Some of these are specific to the Windows Media Device Manager, while others are defined by other SDKs or porting kits used to build a device and bubbled up to the Windows Media Device Manager methods. This section describes the various error codes that can be returned by Windows Media technologies, organized by origin.

**Windows Media Device Manager Error Codes**

The following error codes are defined by the Windows Media Device Manager SDK.



| Return code                            | Description                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| WMDM\_E\_BUFFERTOOSMALL                | The buffer supplied by the caller is too small. The client should increase the size of the buffer and retry the call.                                |
| WMDM\_E\_BUSY                          | The device is busy and cannot satisfy the new request.                                                                                               |

Â 

A service provider should refrain from returning generic failure codes, for example, E\_FAIL. It should return as specific an error code as possible, so that if the error is propagated to an application, the application can give meaningful feedback to the user.

For errors in storage and device related operations, service providers should resort to Win32 error codes. Service providers can use [HRESULT\_FROM\_WIN32](/windows/win32/api/winerror/nf-winerror-hresult_from_win32) to convert Windows error codes to **HRESULT** values and use them as the return values. This macro and the error codes are defined in winerror.h which is a part of the Platform SDK.

**MTP Error Codes**

Devices that supports Media Transport Protocol (MTP) can return the following error codes. Most of the error codes imply an error in the MTP stack, but are helpful in diagnosing the error situation.



| HRESULT    | MTP response code | MTP response code description            | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 0x80042003 | 0x2003            | Session Not Open                         | Indicates that the session handle of the operation is not a currently open session. This indicates an internal error in the MTP stack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 0x80042004 | 0x2004            | Invalid TransactionID                    | Indicates that the TransactionID is zero or does not refer to a valid transaction. This indicates an internal error in the MTP stack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 0x80042005 | 0x2005            | Operation Not Supported                  | Indicates that the operation code appears to be a valid code, but the device does not support the operation. This indicates an internal error in the MTP stack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

This indicates an internal error in the MTP stack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 0x80042007 | 0x2007            | Incomplete Transfer                      | Indicates that the transfer did not complete, and any data transferred should be discarded. This response does not correspond to a cancelled transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 0x80042008 | 0x2008            | Invalid StorageID                        | Indicates that a storage ID sent with an operation does not refer to an actual valid store that is present on the device. This indicates an internal error in the MTP stack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 0x80042009 | 0x2009            | Invalid ObjectHandle                     | Indicates that an object handle does not refer to an actual object that is present on the device. The application should enumerate the storages again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 0x8004200A | 0x200A            | DeviceProp Not Supported                 | Indicates that the device property code appears to be a valid code, but that property is not supported by the device. This indicates an internal error in the MTP stack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 0x80042012 | 0x2012            | Partial Deletion                         | Indicates that only a subset of the storages indicated for deletion were actually deleted, because some were write-protected or were on stores that are read-only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 0x80042013 | 0x2013            | Store Not Available                      | Indicates that the store (or the store that contains the indicated object) is not physically available. This can be caused by media ejection. This response shall not be used to indicate that the store is busy.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 0x80042014 | 0x2014            | Specification By Format Unsupported      | Indicates that the operation attempted to specify action only on objects of a particular format, and that capability is not supported. The operation should be attempted again without specifying by format.
