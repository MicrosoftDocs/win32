# Federated Search in Windows

Windows 7 support for search federation to remote data stores using OpenSearch technologies enables users to access and interact with their remote data from within Windows Explorer.

The following list of topics describe how you can build a web-based data store that can be searched using Windows federated search, and enable rich integration of your remote data sources with Windows Explorer without having to write or deploy any Windows client-side code.

## Additional Resources

-   The [OpenSearch](-search-sample-opensearch.md) code sample demonstrates how to create a federated search service using the [OpenSearch](https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch) protocol, and an OpenSearch Descriptor (.osdx) file (a search connector).
-   For a video demonstration of creating an [OpenSearch](https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch) web service for a SQL database, see [Windows 7: Empower Users to Find, Visualize and Organize their Data with Libraries and the Explorer](https://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC16/).
-   If you are writing a client-side [OpenSearch](https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch) provider, see:
    -   The [OpenSearch Developer How To Guide](https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch/blob/master/mediawiki/Documentation/Developer%20how%20to%20guide.wiki) for more information on connecting to a client-side provider by using a proprietary data store's protocols or APIs.
