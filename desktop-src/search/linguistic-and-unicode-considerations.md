# Linguistic and Unicode Considerations

This section contains a list of linguistic and Unicode considerations that might affect word breaker and stemmer implementation. The list is not an exhaustive one.

This section includes the following topics:

-   [Surface Form Normalization](surface-form-normalization.md)
-   [Miscellaneous Linguistic and Unicode Considerations](miscellaneous-linguistic-and-unicode-considerations.md)

## Additional Resources

-   For a list of lanuages supported by word breakers, see [Languages Supported by Windows Search](-search-3x-wds-language-support.md).
-   If you need to identify the language of a piece of text, you can use Language Auto-Detection (LAD), which is available in Windows 7 and later. For more information, see [Extended Linguistic Services](../intl/extended-linguistic-services.md) (ELS).
-   For applicable reference documentation, see [Data Add-in Interfaces](-search-data-addins-interfaces-entry-page.md).
