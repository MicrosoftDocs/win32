# Full-Text Predicates

The Microsoft Windows Search query language supports two full-text search predicates. The CONTAINS predicate performs comparisons on columns that contain text. The CONTAINS clause can perform matching on single words or phrases, based on the proximity of the search terms. In comparison, the FREETEXT predicate is tuned to match the meaning of the search phrases against text columns.
