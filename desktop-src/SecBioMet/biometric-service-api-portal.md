# Windows Biometric Framework

## Purpose

You can use the Windows Biometric Framework API to create client applications that securely capture, save, and compare end-user biometric information.

## Developer audience

Developers who use this API should be familiar with the C and C++ programming languages and the Windows-based programming environment.

## Run-time requirements

The Windows Biometric Framework API is supported beginning with Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7. For information about run-time requirements for a particular programming element, see the Requirements section of the reference page for that element.
