| Term                                                 | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Windows Biometric Service<br/>                 | A privileged service that manages all biometric devices by using Windows Biometric Driver Interface (WBDI) compliant device drivers.<br/>                                                                                                                   |
| Windows Biometric Driver Interface<br/>        | An interface standard for drivers that manage fingerprint sensors.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Windows Biometric Service Provider (WBSP)<br/> | A component of the Windows Biometric Service that manages a specific category of biometric technology such as a fingerprint reader. WBSPs are built into the Windows Biometric Service. They are not plug-ins and third party BSPs are not supported. <br/> |
| Biometric factor<br/>                          | A personal characteristic that can be measured and used for identification. Examples include fingerprints and hand geometry.<br/>                                                                                                                           |
| Biometric sub-factor<br/>                      | A qualifying characteristic that can be used to further define a biometric factor. For example, to completely identify a fingerprint (biometric factor) it's necessary to specify which finger the print came from (biometric sub-factor).<br/>             |
| Biometric sample<br/>                          | The data that results from the measurement of a single characteristic from a single individual, for example the image of one fingerprint.<br/>                                                                                                              |
| Biometric template<br/>                        | A statistical average generated by collecting multiple biometric samples of a single characteristic for a single individual. A template typically contains only the features that are necessary to determine whether a new sample matches.<br/>             |
| Biometric unit<br/>                            | A software object that represents a biometric device and can be used to capture and process biometric samples and create, save, and match biometric templates.<br/>                                                                                         |
| Sensor adapter<br/>                            | A biometric unit plug-in component that provides a standard interface for configuring the sensor, capturing samples, and controlling the flow of biometric data to the engine adapter.<br/>                                                                 |
| Engine adapter<br/>                            | A biometric unit plug-in component that processes a sample by normalizing data, extracting features, and matching sample data to existing templates.<br/>                                                                                                   |
| Storage adapter<br/>                           | A biometric unit plug-in component that stores, manages, and retrieves templates.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Biometric information record (BIR)<br/>        | A data structure that contains raw or processed biometric information.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Sensor pool<br/>                               | A collection of biometric units that share a common management policy.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Liveness testing<br/>                          | A process that verifies that a biometric sample is not being spoofed or replayed from a sample that was previously collected.<br/>                                                                                                                          |
