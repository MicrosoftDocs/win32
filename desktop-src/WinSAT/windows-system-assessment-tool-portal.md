# Windows System Assessment Tool Provider

\[WinSAT may be altered or unavailable for releases after Windows 8.1.\]

## Purpose

The Windows System Assessment Tool (WinSAT) exposes a number of classes that assesses the performance characteristics and capabilities of a computer. Developers can use this API to develop software that can access the performance and capability information of a computer to determine the optimal application settings based on that computer's performance capabilities.

Users can use the results of a formal assessment to determine which scenarios and applications will perform well on a computer. For example, if a software package contains a rating on its packaging, a user can use the rating to determine whether the software will run well on the computer.

## Developer audience

WinSAT is designed for C, C++, and Visual Basic developers and those who write scripts.

## Run-time requirements

WinSAT is available on client computers starting with the Windows Vista operating system.
