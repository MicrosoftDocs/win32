# WinINet vs. WinHTTP

With a few exceptions, [WinINet](portal.md) is a superset of [WinHTTP](/windows/desktop/WinHttp/winhttp-start-page). When you're choosing between the two, you should use WinINet *unless you plan to run within a service or service-like process that requires impersonation and session isolation*.

## Comparison of features
