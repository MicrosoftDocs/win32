# About WinINet

> [!NOTE]
> For app containers since Windows 10, version 1709, HTTP/2 (see [RFC7540](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540)) is on by default.

The Windows Internet (WinINet) application programming interface (API) enables your application to interact with FTP and HTTP protocols to access Internet resources. As standards evolve, these functions handle the changes in underlying protocols, enabling them to maintain consistent behavior.

**Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 R2 and earlier:** Also enabled applications to interact with Gopher.

## Internet Protocols

The two primary Internet protocols are FTP and HTTP. For more information about these protocols, see the Request For Comments (RFC) documents for FTP and HTTP:

-   [RFC 959](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0959.txt), *File Transfer Protocol (FTP)*.
-   [RFC 1945](ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1945.txt), *Hypertext Transfer Protocol - HTTP/1.0*.
-   [RFC 2616](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt), *Hypertext Transfer Protocol - HTTP/1.1*.
