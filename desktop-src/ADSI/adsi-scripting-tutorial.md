# Active Directory Service Interfaces Scripting

The Microsoft Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI), when combined with a scripting language such as Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition or Microsoft JScript development software, provide a system administrator with powerful tools for managing users, services, print queues, and other parts of a network of computers running Microsoft Windows NT or Windows 2000 operating systems. Scripts using the ADSI object model can replace repetitive manual efforts that would normally be accomplished using administrative tools or the Microsoft Management Console. ADSI scripting can also automate regular system maintenance tasks for hands-free operation, and it provides an easy interface for writing web-based system management tools using Active Server Pages.

For more information about scripting with ADSI, with scripting tutorials, examples and tools, see:
