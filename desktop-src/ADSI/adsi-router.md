# ADSI Router

The ADSI router sits between a client and the ADSI providers. It implements a core set of objects that offer basic features and services common to all the providers. Thus, any feature supported in the router is also supported in any of the providers unless the provider chooses otherwise. The ADSI router module corresponds to Activeds.dll.
