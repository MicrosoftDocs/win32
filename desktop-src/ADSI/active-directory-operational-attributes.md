# Active Directory Operational Attributes

Operational attributes are properties that are stored in and used by the directory for administrative purposes. For example, you might maintain an operational attribute to log the date and time when another attribute is modified. Operational Attributes must be explicitly retrieved with a call to [**GetInfoEx**](/windows/desktop/api/Iads/nf-iads-iads-getinfoex).
