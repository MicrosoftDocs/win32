# Generic ADSI Error Codes

These types of error codes can be returned by any of the ADSI system providers to represent ADSI-specific error messages. They have the facility code 5 with severity bit set either **true** or **false**. When the severity bit is set to **true**, this results in error values of the form 0x80005xxx and error messages of the form **E\_ADS\_\***. When the severity bit is set to **false**, this results in error values of the form 0x00005xxx and the error messages are of the **S\_ADS\_\*** form.

The following table lists generic ADSI error codes defined in Adserr.h.
