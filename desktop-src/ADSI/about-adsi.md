# About Active Directory Service Interfaces

Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI) abstracts the capabilities of directory services from different network providers in a distributed computing environment to present a single set of directory service interfaces for managing network resources. Administrators and developers can use ADSI services to enumerate and manage the resources in a directory service, no matter which network environment contains the resource.

ADSI makes it easier to perform common administrative tasks, such as adding new users, managing printers, and locating resources throughout the distributed computing environment.

ADSI makes it easy for developers to "directory enable" their applications. Administrators and developers handle a single set of directory service interfaces, regardless of which directory services are installed.

## What You Should Know Before Reading This Guide

This guide assumes that you are familiar with the Component Object Model (COM) and Automation, and that you know how to program in either Visual Basic or C/C++.

Some of the terms used in this guide are unique to either ADSI or the directory services environment. Other terms will be familiar but may have slightly different meanings in these environments.
