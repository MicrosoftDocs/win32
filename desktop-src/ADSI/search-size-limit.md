# Search Size Limit

To reduce memory requirements, a client can focus on a small number of objects returned from the server and ignore the rest of the result set. To accomplish this, the client specifies a search size limit and other appropriate search criteria. For example, if a directory stores the test scores of a school district, you can query the top ten students with the highest test scores by specifying a size limit of ten and a descending sort order.

For more information about using the search size limit option with a specific search interface, see:
