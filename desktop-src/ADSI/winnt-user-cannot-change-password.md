# User Cannot Change Password (WinNT Provider)

The ability of a user to change their password is a permission that can be granted or denied. For more information about programmatically reading and modifying this permission using the WinNT provider, see:

-   [Reading User Cannot Change Password (WinNT Provider)](reading-user-cannot-change-password-winnt-provider.md)
-   [Modifying User Cannot Change Password (WinNT Provider)](modifying-user-cannot-change-password-winnt-provider.md)

The **userFlags** attribute of the user object is only available when using the WinNT provider.

It is also possible to read and modify this permission using the LDAP provider. For more information, see [User Cannot Change Password (LDAP Provider)](user-cannot-change-password.md).
