# ADSI Extensions

An ADSI extension is a special COM object that enable a developer to extend an ADSI object. Each extension is associated with a specified class in the directory. With this extension model, developers can add methods to give more dynamic meaning to an object. In a traditional directory programming model, an object is accessed by getting and setting the object attributes. Using ADSI extensions, you can add more features to a directory object.
