# User Cannot Change Password (LDAP Provider)

The ability of a user to change their own password is a permission that can be granted or denied. For more information about programmatically reading and modifying this permission using the LDAP provider, see:

-   [Reading User Cannot Change Password (LDAP Provider)](reading-user-cannot-change-password-ldap-provider.md)
-   [Modifying User Cannot Change Password (LDAP Provider)](modifying-user-cannot-change-password-ldap-provider.md)

It is easier to read and modify the User Cannot Change Password setting using the WinNT provider. For more information, see [User Cannot Change Password (WinNT Provider)](winnt-user-cannot-change-password.md).
