# Binding Types Specific to Active Directory

In addition to the LDAP bindings discussed previously, Active Directory introduces several new concepts for binding to an object. See the following topics in the [Active Directory Domain Services](/windows/desktop/AD/active-directory-domain-services) documentation:

-   [Serverless Binding and RootDSE](/windows/desktop/AD/serverless-binding-and-rootdse)
-   [Binding to the Global Catalog](/windows/desktop/AD/binding-to-the-global-catalog)
