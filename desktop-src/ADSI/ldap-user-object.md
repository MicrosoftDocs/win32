# LDAP User Object

The following topics are discussed for the LDAP user object:

-   [Mapping Between IADsUser properties and Active Directory Attributes](mapping-between-iadsuser-properties-and-active-directory-attributes.md)
-   [User Creation with the ADSI LDAP Provider](user-creation-with-the-adsi-ldap-provider.md)
-   [Setting and Changing User Passwords with the LDAP Provider](setting-user-passwords-for-ldap-providers.md)
-   [Examples of User Management in Active Directory](examples-of-user-management-in-active-directory.md)

In addition, the user object in Active Directory contains many more properties than are listed in the [IADsUser](iadsuser-property-methods.md) section. Because Active Directory Schema is extensible, other vendors may add additional attributes to a class, as well.
