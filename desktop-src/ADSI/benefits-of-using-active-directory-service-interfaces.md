# Benefits of Using Active Directory Service Interfaces

ADSI offers many benefits to system administrators, as described in the following table.



| Feature                   | Benefit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Open                      | Any directory provider can implement an ADSI provider; users gain freedom of choice in directory services without sacrificing manageability.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| DS independent            | Administrative applications are not tightly bound to a given vendor's directory service. Administrative and other directory-enabled applications can be developed with no need to understand vendor-specific directory APIs. The same application can work on multiple directories. Development time and support costs are reduced. |
| Multiple language support | ADSI objects provide easy access to directory services through the component object model. COM applications can be written in languages such as Microsoft Visual Basic, Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), and C/C++.                                                                                             |
| Simple programming model  | ADSI consists of a small, easy-to-learn set of interfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Scriptable                | Any Automation compatible language (for example, Visual Basic, VBScript, Perl, Rexx, and others) can be used to develop directory service applications. Administrators and developers can use the tools they already know. Productivity is enhanced — development time and support costs are reduced.                               |
| Functionally rich         | ISVs and sophisticated end users can develop serious applications using the same ADSI models that are used for simple scripted administrative applications.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Extensible                | Directory providers, ISVs, and end users can extend ADSI with new objects and functions to add value or meet unique needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| OLE DB aware              | ADSI provides an OLE DB interface so that programmers familiar with database programming through OLE DB can be productive quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
