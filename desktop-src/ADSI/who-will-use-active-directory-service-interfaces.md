# Who Will Use Active Directory Service Interfaces?

Network administrators will use ADSI to automate common administrative tasks such as adding users and groups, managing printers, and setting permissions on network resources.

Independent software vendors (ISVs) and end user developers will use ADSI to "directory enable" their products and applications. Services can publish themselves in a directory, clients can use the directory to find the services, and both can use the directory to find and manipulate other objects of interest. Because Active Directory Service Interfaces are independent of the underlying directory services, the directory enabled products and applications will operate successfully in multiple network and directory environments.
