# Provider Minimum Requirements

To write an ADSI provider, implement the Active Directory Service Interfaces as described in the following sections.

-   [Core Implementation](core-implementation.md) briefly lists those software elements that an ADSI provider must support.
-   [Optional Implementation](optional-implementation.md) briefly lists those software elements that an ADSI provider is strongly encouraged to support.
-   [Custom Properties](custom-properties.md) are those properties and interfaces exposed by each provider to provide programmability of the native features of the directory service.
-   [Dual Interfaces](dual-interfaces.md) describe the ADSI convention to supply interfaces that are accessible both to Automation and non-Automation compliant controllers.
