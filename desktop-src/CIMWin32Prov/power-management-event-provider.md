# Power Management Event Provider

The Power Management provider allows WMI to model the Windows power management protocols. As an event provider, the Power Management provider supplies information to the [**Win32\_PowerManagementEvent**](win32-powermanagementevent.md) class to describe power management events that result from power state changes. These state changes are associated with either the advanced power management (APM) or the advanced configuration and power interface (ACPI) system management protocols. The [**\_\_Win32Provider**](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/--win32provider) instance name is "MS\_Power\_Management\_Event\_Provider".
