# PauseService method of the Win32_Service class (CIMWin32 WMI Providers)

The **PauseService** [WMI class](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/retrieving-a-class) method attempts to place the service in the paused state.

This topic uses Managed Object Format (MOF) syntax. For more information about using this method, see [Calling a Method](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/calling-a-method).

## Syntax


```mof
uint32 PauseService();
```



## Parameters

This method has no parameters.

## Return value

Returns one of the values listed in the following list, or any other value to indicate an error. For additional error codes, see [**WMI Error Constants**](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/wmi-error-constants) or [**WbemErrorEnum**](/windows/desktop/api/wbemdisp/ne-wbemdisp-wbemerrorenum). For general **HRESULT** values, see [System Error Codes](/windows/desktop/Debug/system-error-codes).

## Remarks

After you have determined which services can be stopped or paused, you can use the [**StopService**](stopservice-method-in-class-win32-service.md) and [**PauseService**](pauseservice-method-in-class-win32-systemdriver.md) methods to stop and pause services. The decision to stop a service rather than pause it, or vice versa, depends on several factors, including the following:

-   Is the service capable of being paused? If not, your only option is the stop the service.
-   Do you need to continue handling client requests for anyone already connected to the service? If so, pausing a service typically allows it to handle existing clients while denying access to new clients. By contrast, when you stop a service, all clients are immediately disconnected.
-   Do you need to reconfigure a service and have the changes take effect immediately? Although service properties can be changed while a service is paused, most of them do not take effect until the service is actually stopped and restarted.

The scripting code required to stop a service is almost identical to the code required to pause the service.

## Examples

The [Pause Services Running Under a Specific Account](https://Gallery.TechNet.Microsoft.Com/12a256dd-39da-4690-b3f0-f0adccaf25f1) VBScript sample Pauses all services running under the hypothetical service account "Netsvc".

The following VBScript code sample demonstrates how to pause a specific service from instances of [**Win32\_Service**](win32-service.md).

> [!Note]  
> The service must support pausing and be running already.

 


```VB
Set ServiceSet = GetObject("winmgmts:").ExecQuery("select * from Win32_Service where Name='Schedule'")

for each Service in ServiceSet
 SupportsPause = Service.AcceptPause
 if SupportsPause = true then
  RetVal = Service.PauseService()
  if RetVal = 0 then 
   WScript.Echo "Service paused"   
  else
   if RetVal = 1 then 
    WScript.Echo "Pause not supported" 
   else WScript.Echo "An error occurred:" & RetVal
   End If
  End If
 else
  WScript.Echo "Service does not support pause"
 end if
next
```



The following Perl code sample demonstrates how to pause a specific service from instances of [**Win32\_Service**](win32-service.md).

> [!Note]  
> The service must support pausing and be running already.

 


```
use strict;
use Win32::OLE;

my ($ServiceSet, $SupportsPause, $RetVal);  
eval {$ServiceSet = Win32::OLE->GetObject("winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\\\.\\Root\\CIMv2")->
 ExecQuery("SELECT * FROM Win32_Service WHERE Name='Schedule'"); };
unless($@)
{
 foreach my $ServiceInst (in $ServiceSet)
 {
  if ($ServiceInst->{AcceptPause})
  {
   $RetVal = $ServiceInst->PauseService();
   if ($RetVal == 0)
   {
    print "\nService paused\n";
   }
   else
   {
    if ($RetVal == 1)
    {
     print "\nPause not supported\n" ;
    }
    else 
    {
     print "\nAn error occurred:", $RetVal, "\n";
    }
   } 
  }
  else
  {
   print "\nService does not support pause\n";
  }
 }
}
else
{
 print STDERR "\n", Win32::OLE->LastError, "\n";
}
```
