# StopService method of the Win32_Service class (Sdoias.h)

The **StopService** [WMI class](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/retrieving-a-class) method places the service, represented by the [**Win32\_Service**](win32-service.md) object, in the stopped state.

This topic uses Managed Object Format (MOF) syntax. For more information about using this method, see [Calling a Method](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/calling-a-method).

## Syntax


```mof
uint32 StopService();
```



## Parameters

This method has no parameters.

## Return value

Returns one of the values listed in the following list, or any other value to indicate an error. For additional error codes, see [**WMI Error Constants**](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/wmi-error-constants) or [**WbemErrorEnum**](/windows/desktop/api/wbemdisp/ne-wbemdisp-wbemerrorenum). For general **HRESULT** values, see [System Error Codes](/windows/desktop/Debug/system-error-codes).

## Remarks

After you have determined which services can be stopped or paused, you can use the **StopService** and [**PauseService**](pauseservice-method-in-class-win32-systemdriver.md) methods to stop and pause services. The decision to stop a service rather than pause it, or vice versa, depends on several factors, including the following:

-   Is the service capable of being paused? If not, your only option is the stop the service.
-   Do you need to continue handling client requests for anyone already connected to the service? If so, pausing a service typically allows it to handle existing clients while denying access to new clients. By contrast, when you stop a service, all clients are immediately disconnected.
-   Do you need to reconfigure a service and have the changes take effect immediately? Although service properties can be changed while a service is paused, most of them do not take effect until the service is actually stopped and restarted.

The scripting code required to stop a service is almost identical to the code required to pause the service.

If you attempt to stop a service which has dependent services running, the **StopService** method fails with a return value of 3. The dependent services must be stopped first.

If you stop a service, then immediately check the [**Win32\_Service**](win32-service.md).**State** property, as the value may still show the service as running.

## Examples

[The Set-RemoteService](https://Gallery.TechNet.Microsoft.Com/79595ce9-bfc3-463e-9e84-d9e0b78590c1) PowerShell sample Sets service state for remote machines.

The [Stop a Service and Its Dependents](https://Gallery.TechNet.Microsoft.Com/ae07e623-2cbd-4983-b991-aa4d1e6e2732) VBScript sample stops a service and all dependent services.

The following VBScript code sample demonstrates how to shut down a service.


```VB
Set ServiceSet = GetObject("winmgmts:").ExecQuery("select * from Win32_Service where Name='ClipSrv'")

for each Service in ServiceSet
 RetVal = Service.StopService()
 if RetVal = 0 then 
  WScript.Echo "Service stopped" 
 elseif RetVal = 5 then 
  WScript.Echo "Service already stopped" 
 end if
next
```



The following Perl code sample demonstrates how to shut down a service.


```
use strict;
use Win32::OLE;

my $ServiceSet;

eval { $ServiceSet = 
 Win32::OLE->GetObject("winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\\\.\\root\\cimv2")->
 ExecQuery("SELECT * FROM Win32_Service WHERE Name='ClipSrv'"); };

if (!$@ && defined $ServiceSet)
{
 foreach my $ServiceInst (in $ServiceSet)
 {
  my $Result = $ServiceInst->StopService();
  if ($Result == 0)
  {
   print "\nService stopped\n";
  }
  elsif ($Result == 5) 
  {
   print "\nService already stopped\n";
  }
 }
}
else
{
 print STDERR Win32::OLE->LastError, "\n";
}
```



The following VBScript code example shows that you cannot stop the NetDDE service until the dependent services have been stopped. To run the script, ensure that the NetDDE service and its dependent services are running by using the Services.msc MMC snap-in or the **Net Start** command.

The [**Win32\_DependentService**](win32-dependentservice.md) class allows you to locate service dependencies through an [Associators Of](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/associators-of-statement) query.


```VB
strComputer = "."
Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:" _
    & "{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\" & _
    strComputer & "\root\cimv2")

Set objNetDDEservice = _
    objWMIService.Get("Win32_Service.Name='NetDDE'")

WScript.Echo "NetDDE service state: " & objNetDDEService.State
WScript.Echo "Stopping NetDDE service"
Return = objNetDDEService.StopService()
WScript.Echo "Return value: " & Return  & _
    "  Service cannot be stopped because " & _
    "dependent services are running"

Set colServiceList = objWMIService.ExecQuery("Associators of " _
    & "{Win32_Service.Name='NetDDE'} Where " _
        & "AssocClass=Win32_DependentService " & _
    "Role=Antecedent" )

For Each objService in colServiceList
   WScript.Echo "Dependent service: " & objService.Name & _
   "   State: " & objService.State
   WScript.Echo "Stopping dependent service " & objService.Name
   objService.StopService()    
Next

Wscript.Sleep 20000
WScript.Echo "Stopping NetDDE service"
Return = objNetDDEService.StopService()
WScript.Echo "Return value: " & Return
```
