# CIM\_PhysicalCapacity class

The **CIM\_PhysicalCapacity** class is an abstract class that represents a physical element's minimum and maximum requirements and its ability to support different types of hardware. For example, minimum and maximum memory requirements can be modeled as a subclass of **CIM\_PhysicalCapacity**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The DMTF (Distributed Management Task Force) CIM (Common Information Model) classes are the parent classes upon which WMI classes are built. WMI currently supports only the [CIM 2.x version schemas](https://dmtf.org/standards/cim/schemas).

 

The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all of its inherited properties. Properties are listed in alphabetic order, not MOF order.

## Syntax

``` syntax

class CIM_PhysicalCapacity
{
  string Caption;
  string Description;
  string Name;
};
```
