# CIM\_ConnectorOnPackage class

The **CIM\_ConnectorOnPackage** class represents an association that makes explicit the containment relationship between connectors and packages. Physical packages contain connectors as well as other physical elements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The DMTF (Distributed Management Task Force) CIM (Common Information Model) classes are the parent classes upon which WMI classes are built. WMI currently supports only the [CIM 2.x version schemas](https://dmtf.org/standards/cim/schemas).

 

The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties. Properties are listed in alphabetic order, not MOF order.

## Syntax

``` syntax
[Abstract, UUID("{FAF76B8C-798C-11D2-AAD1-006008C78BC7}"), AMENDMENT]
class CIM_ConnectorOnPackage : CIM_Container
{
  string                    LocationWithinContainer;
  CIM_PhysicalConnector REF PartComponent;
  CIM_PhysicalPackage   REF GroupComponent;
};
```

## Members

### Properties

The **CIM\_ConnectorOnPackage** class has these properties.

<dl> <dt>

**GroupComponent**
</dt> <dd> <dl> <dt>

Data type: **CIM\_PhysicalPackage**
</dt> <dt>

Access type: Read-only
</dt> <dt>

Qualifiers: [**Override**](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/standard-qualifiers) ("GroupComponent"), [**Max**](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/standard-qualifiers) (1)
</dt> </dl>

A [**CIM\_PhysicalPackage**](cim-physicalpackage.md) that describes the physical package that has a connector.

</dd> <dt>

**LocationWithinContainer**
</dt> <dd> <dl> <dt>

Data type: **string**
</dt> <dt>

Access type: Read-only
</dt> </dl>

Free-form string that represents the positioning of the physical element within the physical package. Information relative to stationary elements in the container (for example, "second drive bay from the top"), angles, altitudes, and other data can be recorded in this property. This string could supplement or be used in place of instantiating the [**CIM\_Location**](cim-location.md) object.

This property is inherited from [**CIM\_Container**](cim-container.md).

</dd> <dt>

**PartComponent**
</dt> <dd> <dl> <dt>

Data type: **CIM\_PhysicalConnector**
</dt> <dt>

Access type: Read-only
</dt> <dt>

Qualifiers: [**Override**](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/standard-qualifiers) ("PartComponent")
</dt> </dl>

A [**CIM\_PhysicalConnector**](cim-physicalconnector.md) that describes the physical connector.

</dd> </dl>

## Remarks

The **CIM\_ConnectorOnPackage** class is derived from [**CIM\_Container**](cim-container.md).

WMI does not implement this class.

This documentation is derived from the CIM class descriptions published by the DMTF. Microsoft may have made changes to correct minor errors, conform to Microsoft SDK documentation standards, or provide more information.
