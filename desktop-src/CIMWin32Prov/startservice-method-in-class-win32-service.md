# StartService method of the Win32_Service class (CIMWin32 WMI Providers)

The **StartService** method attempts to place the referenced service into its startup state.

This topic uses Managed Object Format (MOF) syntax. For more information about using this method, see [Calling a Method](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/calling-a-method).

## Syntax


```mof
uint32 StartService();
```



## Parameters

This method has no parameters.

## Return value

Returns one of the values listed in the following list, or any other value to indicate an error. For additional error codes, see [**WMI Error Constants**](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/wmi-error-constants) or [**WbemErrorEnum**](/windows/desktop/api/wbemdisp/ne-wbemdisp-wbemerrorenum). For general **HRESULT** values, see [System Error Codes](/windows/desktop/Debug/system-error-codes).

## Remarks

Although there might appear to be no practical difference between a service that is stopped and a service that is paused, the two states appear differently to the SCM. A stopped service is a service that is not running and must go through the entire service start procedure. A paused service, however, is still running but has had its functioning is suspended. Because of this, a paused service does not need to go through the entire service start procedure but needs a different procedure to resume functioning.

You must use the proper method to start a service that has been stopped or to resume a service that has been paused. The [**Win32\_Service**](win32-service.md) methods **StartService** and [**ResumeService**](resumeservice-method-in-class-win32-service.md) should be used in the following situations:

-   If a service is currently stopped, you must use the **StartService** method to restart it; [**ResumeService**](resumeservice-method-in-class-win32-service.md) cannot start a service that is currently stopped.
-   If a service is paused, you must use [**ResumeService**](resumeservice-method-in-class-win32-service.md). If you use the **StartService** method on a paused service, you receive the message, "The service is already running." However, the service remains paused until the resume service control code is sent to it.

If you start a stopped service that depends on another service, then both services are started. When a service is started with this method, any dependent services are not automatically started. You must use the association class [**Win32\_DependentService**](win32-dependentservice.md) and the [Associators Of](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/associators-of-statement) query to locate the dependents and start them separately.

## Examples

The [Remotely Enable RDP](https://Gallery.TechNet.Microsoft.Com/Remotely-Enable-RDP-855c3842) PowerShell sample remotely enables the Remote Desktop service.

The [Stop, Start, Enable or Disable Service](https://Gallery.TechNet.Microsoft.Com/212e68f0-5279-4499-8e9e-6aa1807719c0) PowerShell sample starts, stops, enables, or disables a service.

The following VBSScript code sample demonstrates how to start a specific service from instances of [**Win32\_Service**](win32-service.md).


```VB
Set ServiceSet = GetObject("winmgmts:").ExecQuery("select * from Win32_Service where Name='ClipSrv'")

for each Service in ServiceSet
 RetVal = Service.StartService()
 if RetVal = 0 then WScript.Echo "Service started"
 if RetVal = 10 then WScript.Echo "Service already running"
next
```



The following Perl code sample demonstrates how to start a specific service from instances of [**Win32\_Service**](win32-service.md).


```
use strict;
use Win32::OLE;

my $ServiceSet;

eval { $ServiceSet = 
 Win32::OLE->GetObject("winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\\\.\\root\\cimv2")->
 ExecQuery("SELECT * FROM Win32_Service WHERE Name='ClipSrv'"); };

if(!$@ && defined $ServiceSet)
{
 foreach my $service (in $ServiceSet)
 {
  my $Result = $service->StartService();
  if ($Result == 0) 
  {
   print "\nService started\n";
  }
  elsif ($Result == 10)
  {
   print "\nService already running\n";
  }
 }
}
else
{
 print STDERR Win32::OLE->LastError, "\n";
}
```



The following VBScript code example, NetDDE, is dependent on the NetDDEDSDM service. The script locates the class on which NetDDE depends and starts it, which does not automatically start NetDDE.


```VB
strComputer = "."
Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\" & strComputer & "\root\cimv2")

' Stop NetDDE if it is running
Set objNetDDEService = objWMIService.Get("Win32_Service.Name='NetDDE'")
Return = objNetDDEService.StopService()

' NetDDE is in the dependent role to another service
Set colServiceList = objWMIService.ExecQuery("Associators of " _
    & "{Win32_Service.Name='NetDDE'} Where " & "AssocClass=Win32_DependentService " & "Role=Dependent" )

' start the service on which NetDDE is dependent
For Each objService in colServiceList
    WScript.Echo "Starting " & objService.Name
    Return = objService.StartService()
    If Return = 0 Then
        WScript.Echo "Parent service " & objService.Name & " started successfully"
    Else
        WScript.Echo "Parent service " & objService.Name & " did not start. Return = " & Return
    End If
Next

' NetDDE is still stopped
Set objNetDDEService = _
    objWMIService.Get("Win32_Service.Name='NetDDE'")
WScript.Echo "Dependent NetDDE service is " & objNetDDEService.State
```
