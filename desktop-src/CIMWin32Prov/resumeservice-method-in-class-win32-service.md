# ResumeService method of the Win32_Service class (CIMWin32 WMI Providers)

The **ResumeService** [WMI class](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/retrieving-a-class) method attempts to place the referenced service in the resumed state.

This topic uses Managed Object Format (MOF) syntax. For more information about using this method, see [Calling a Method](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/calling-a-method).

## Syntax


```mof
uint32 ResumeService();
```



## Parameters

This method has no parameters.

## Return value

Returns one of the values listed in the following list, or any other value to indicate an error. For additional error codes, see [**WMI Error Constants**](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/wmi-error-constants) or [**WbemErrorEnum**](/windows/desktop/api/wbemdisp/ne-wbemdisp-wbemerrorenum). For general **HRESULT** values, see [System Error Codes](/windows/desktop/Debug/system-error-codes).

## Remarks

Although there might appear to be no practical difference between a service that is stopped and a service that is paused, the two states appear differently to the SCM. A stopped service is a service that is not running and must go through the entire service start procedure. A paused service, however, is still running but has had its functioning is suspended. Because of this, a paused service does not need to go through the entire service start procedure but needs a different procedure to resume functioning.

You must use the proper method to start a service that has been stopped or to resume a service that has been paused. The [**Win32\_Service**](win32-service.md) methods [**StartService**](startservice-method-in-class-win32-service.md) and **ResumeService** should be used in the following situations:

-   If a service is currently stopped, you must use the [**StartService**](startservice-method-in-class-win32-service.md) method to restart it; **ResumeService** cannot start a service that is currently stopped.
-   If a service is paused, you must use **ResumeService**. If you use the [**StartService**](startservice-method-in-class-win32-service.md) method on a paused service, you receive the message, "The service is already running." However, the service remains paused until the resume service control code is sent to it.

## Examples

The [Resume AutoStart Services that are Paused](https://Gallery.TechNet.Microsoft.Com/413f2896-e7f3-4b3e-96cb-5abdc9bb6c36) VBScript sample restarts any auto-start services that have been paused.

The following VBScript code sample describes how to resume a paused service from instances of [**Win32\_Service**](win32-service.md).

> [!Note]  
> The service must support pausing and be running already.

 


```VB
Set ServiceSet = GetObject("winmgmts:").ExecQuery("select * from Win32_Service where Name='Schedule'")

for each Service in ServiceSet
 SupportsPause = Service.AcceptPause
 if SupportsPause = true then
  RetVal = Service.ResumeService()
  if RetVal = 0 then 
   WScript.Echo "Service resumed"   
  else
   if RetVal = 1 then 
    WScript.Echo "Pause not supported" 
   else WScript.Echo "An error occurred:" & RetVal
   End If
  End If
 else
  WScript.Echo "Service does not support pause"
 end if
next
```



The following Perl code sample describes how to resume a paused service from instances of [**Win32\_Service**](win32-service.md).

> [!Note]  
> The service must support pausing and be running already.

 


```Perl
use strict;
use Win32::OLE;

my $ServiceSet;

eval { $ServiceSet = Win32::OLE->GetObject("winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\\\.\\Root\\CIMv2")->
 ExecQuery("SELECT * FROM Win32_Service WHERE Name='Schedule'"); };

if (!$@ && defined $ServiceSet)
{
 foreach my $Service (in $ServiceSet)
 {
  my $SupportsPause = $Service->{AcceptPause};
  if ($SupportsPause)
  {
   my $RetVal = $Service->ResumeService();
   if ($RetVal == 0)
   {
    print "\nService resumed\n";
   }
   else
   {
    if ($RetVal == 1)
    {
     print STDERR "\nPause not supported\n";
    }
    else
    {
     print STDERR "\nAn error occurred: ", $RetVal, "\n";
    }
   }
  }
  else
  {
   print "\nService does not support pause\n";
  }
 }
}
else
{
 print STDERR Win32::OLE->LastError, "\n";
}
```
