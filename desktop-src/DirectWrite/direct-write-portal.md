# DirectWrite (DWrite)

## Purpose

Today's applications must support high-quality text rendering, resolution-independent outline fonts, and full Unicode text and layout support. DirectWrite, a [DirectX](../directx.md) API, provides these features and more.

- A device-independent text layout system that improves text readability in documents and in UI.
- High-quality, sub-pixel, [Microsoft ClearType](/typography/cleartype/) text rendering that can use [GDI](interoperating-with-gdi.md), [Direct2D](rendering-by-using-direct2d.md), or application-specific rendering technology.
- Hardware-accelerated text, when used with [Direct2D](rendering-by-using-direct2d.md).
- Support for multi-format text.
- Support for the advanced typography features of OpenType fonts.
- Support for the layout and rendering of text in all supported languages.
- [GDI](interoperating-with-gdi.md)-compatible layout and rendering.

The API supports measuring, drawing, and hit-testing of multi-format text. DirectWrite handles text in all supported languages for global and localized applications, building on the key language infrastructure found in Windows 7. DirectWrite also provides a low-level glyph rendering API for developers who want to perform their own layout and Unicode-to-glyph processing.

> [!NOTE]
> [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/) introduces a new version of DirectWrite&mdash;called DWriteCore&mdash;that runs on versions of Windows down to Windows 8, and opens the door for you to use it cross-platform. For more details, see [DWriteCore overview](dwritecore-overview.md).

## Run-time requirements

- Windows 7 or Windows Vista with Service Pack 2 (SP2) and Platform Update for Windows Vista
- Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2008 with Service Pack 2 (SP2) and Platform Update for Windows Server 2008
