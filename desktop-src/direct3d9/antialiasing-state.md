# Antialiasing State (Direct3D 9)

[Antialiasing (Direct3D 9)](antialiasing.md) is a method of making lines and edges appear smoother on the screen. By default, Direct3D does not perform antialiasing. To enable full-scene antialiasing, set the D3DRS\_MULTISAMPLEANTIALIAS render state to **TRUE**. To disable it, set D3DRS\_MULTISAMPLEANTIALIAS to **FALSE**.
