# Fog Types (Direct3D 9)

There are two ways to add fog to a scene: with pixel fog and/or vertex fog. The following topics illustrate the formulas used in fog equations, as well as implementing vertex and pixel fog. An application can implement fog with a vertex shader, and pixel fog simultaneously if desired.

-   [Fog Formulas](fog-formulas.md)
-   [Fog Parameters](fog-parameters.md)
-   [Fog Blending](fog-blending.md)
-   [Fog Color](fog-color.md)
-   [Vertex Fog](vertex-fog.md)
-   [Pixel Fog](pixel-fog.md)

Fog blending is controlled by render states; it is not part of the programmable pixel pipeline.
