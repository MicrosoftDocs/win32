# Advanced Topics (Direct3D 9)

Microsoft Direct3D provides a powerful set of tools that you can use to increase the realistic appearance of a 3D scene. Once you have mastered the topics in [Getting Started (Direct3D 9)](getting-started.md), you can move on to advanced topics like antialiasing, working with the frame buffer, querying for resource status, and profiling your application.

The following topics contain more information:

-   [Vertex Pipeline](vertex-pipeline.md)
-   [Pixel Pipeline](pixel-pipeline.md)
-   [Frame Buffer](frame-buffer.md)
-   [Precomputed Radiance Transfer](precomputed-radiance-transfer.md)
-   [HDR Lighting](hdr-lighting.md)
-   [Accurately Profiling Direct3D API Calls](accurately-profiling-direct3d-api-calls.md)
-   [Setting device state with the fixed-function and programmable shader pipeline](setting-render-states-with-fixed-function-and-programmable-shader-pipeline.md)
-   [Queries](queries.md)
-   [Efficiently Drawing Multiple Instances of Geometry](efficiently-drawing-multiple-instances-of-geometry.md)
-   [Using UVAtlas](using-uvatlas.md)
