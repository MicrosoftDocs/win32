The values in the table are delimited by quotes to call attention to the number of characters in each value. Those with 4 bytes contain four characters, those with 2 bytes contain two characters.

Comments are applicable only in text files. Comments can occur anywhere in the data stream. A comment begins with either C++ style double-slashes (//), or a pound sign (\#). The comment runs to the next new line. The following example shows valid comments.


```
#  This is a comment.
// This is another comment.
```
