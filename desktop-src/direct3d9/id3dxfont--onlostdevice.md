# ID3DXFont::OnLostDevice method

Use this method to release all references to video memory resources and delete all stateblocks. This method should be called whenever a device is lost, or before resetting a device.

## Syntax


```C++
HRESULT OnLostDevice();
```



## Parameters

This method has no parameters.

## Return value

Type: **[**HRESULT**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb401631(v=MSDN.10).aspx)**

If the method succeeds, the return value is S\_OK. If the method fails, the return value can be D3DERR\_INVALIDCALL.

## Remarks

This method should be called whenever the device is lost or before the user calls [**Reset**](/windows/desktop/api). Even if the device was not actually lost, **OnLostDevice** is responsible for freeing stateblocks and other resources that may need to be released before resetting the device. As a result, the font object cannot be used again before calling **Reset** and then [**OnResetDevice**](id3dxfont--onresetdevice.md).
