# Effect Reference (Direct3D 9 Graphics)

Effects are a higher level abstraction that take advantage of vertex and pixel shaders to encapsulate rendering effects. Effects can be written with the high-level language or with the shader assembly language.

Here are the API topics.

-   [Effect Interfaces](dx9-graphics-reference-effects-interfaces.md)
-   [Effect Functions](dx9-graphics-reference-effects-functions.md)
-   [Effect Structures](dx9-graphics-reference-effects-structures.md)
-   [Effect Constants](dx9-graphics-reference-effects-constants.md)
-   [Effect Format (Direct3D 9)](dx9-graphics-reference-effects-file-format.md)
-   [DirectX Standard Annotations and Semantics Reference](dx9-graphics-reference-effects-dxsas.md)

As an alternative to using the API to create effects, you can also use a command line compile tool. See [Effect-Compiler Tool](../direct3dtools/fxc.md).
