# Rendering from User Memory Pointers (Direct3D 9)

A secondary set of rendering interfaces supports passing vertex and index data directly from user memory pointers. These interfaces support a single stream of vertex data only. For more information, see the following reference topics.

-   [**IDirect3DDevice9::DrawPrimitiveUP**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb174372(v=VS.85).aspx)
-   [**IDirect3DDevice9::DrawIndexedPrimitiveUP**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb174370(v=VS.85).aspx)

These methods render with data specified by user memory pointers, instead of vertex and index buffers.
