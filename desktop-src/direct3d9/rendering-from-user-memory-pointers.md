# Rendering from User Memory Pointers (Direct3D 9)

A secondary set of rendering interfaces supports passing vertex and index data directly from user memory pointers. These interfaces support a single stream of vertex data only. For more information, see the following reference topics.

-   [**IDirect3DDevice9::DrawPrimitiveUP**](/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-drawprimitiveup)
-   [**IDirect3DDevice9::DrawIndexedPrimitiveUP**](/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-drawindexedprimitiveup)

These methods render with data specified by user memory pointers, instead of vertex and index buffers.
