# Direct3D Textures (Direct3D 9)

Textures are a powerful tool in creating realism in computer-generated 3D images. Direct3D supports an extensive texturing feature set, providing developers with easy access to advanced texturing techniques.

This section will get you started using textures.

-   [Texture Filtering (Direct3D 9)](texture-filtering.md)
-   [Texture Resources (Direct3D 9)](texture-resources.md)
-   [Texture Wrapping (Direct3D 9)](texture-wrapping.md)
-   [Texture Blending (Direct3D 9)](texture-blending.md)

These topics will go into more detail about additional texturing functionality.

-   [Automatic Texture Management (Direct3D 9)](automatic-texture-management.md)

-   [Hardware Considerations for Texturing (Direct3D 9)](hardware-considerations-for-texturing.md)
-   [Volume Texture Resources (Direct3D 9)](volume-texture-resources.md)

For improved performance, consider using dynamic textures. A dynamic texture can be locked, written to, and unlocked each frame. See [Using Dynamic Textures](performance-optimizations.md).
