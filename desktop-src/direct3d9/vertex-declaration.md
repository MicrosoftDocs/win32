# Vertex Declaration (Direct3D 9)

A vertex declaration defines the vertex buffer layout and programs the tessellation engine. Starting with Direct3D 9, vertex streams are expressed as an array of [**D3DVERTEXELEMENT9**](d3dvertexelement9.md) structures (instead of using flexible vertex format (FVF) codes). Each array element describes each per-vertex data type. Converting FVF> codes into the new format is covered in the following topics:

-   [Mapping FVF Codes to a Direct3D 9 Declaration (Direct3D 9)](mapping-fvf-codes-to-a-directx-9-declaration.md)
-   [Fixed Function FVF Codes (Direct3D 9)](fixed-function-fvf-codes.md)
-   [Mapping between a Direct3D Declaration and FVF Codes (Direct3D 9)](mapping-between-a-directx-9-declaration-and-fvf-codes.md)
-   [Mapping between a Direct3D 9 Declaration and a Direct3D 8 Declaration (Direct3D 9)](mapping-between-a-directx-9-declaration-and-directx-8.md)
-   [Programming One or More Streams (Direct3D 9)](programming-one-or-more-streams.md)
