# Manipulating the Depth Buffer (Direct3D 9)

Depth buffers are associated with the device. Applications are required to move the depth buffers when they set render targets. The [**IDirect3DDevice9::GetDepthStencilSurface**](/windows/desktop/api) and [**IDirect3DDevice9::SetDepthStencilSurface**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb174431(v=VS.85).aspx) methods are used to manipulate depth buffers.
