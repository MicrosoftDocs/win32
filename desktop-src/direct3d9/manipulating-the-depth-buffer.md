# Manipulating the Depth Buffer (Direct3D 9)

Depth buffers are associated with the device. Applications are required to move the depth buffers when they set render targets. The [**IDirect3DDevice9::GetDepthStencilSurface**](/windows/desktop/api) and [**IDirect3DDevice9::SetDepthStencilSurface**](/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-setdepthstencilsurface) methods are used to manipulate depth buffers.
