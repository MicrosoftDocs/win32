# Casting and Conversion

When transferring values between the host application and an effect parameter, data is written as expected when the source data type (in the host application) matches the destination data type (in the effect parameter). When the data types differ, casting will occur as the source data is rearranged to fit the destination.

DXSAS defines the following type conversion rules. These are a superset of the effect (.fx) and HLSL type conversion rules. DXSAS also defines some [Parameter Value Modifiers](#parameter-value-modifiers) that can affect the value being transferred from the host application to a bound parameter.

## Type Casting

The following table lists the casting that will occur when one data type is transferred to another data type:

## Class Casting

In addition to the type casting rules described above, DXSAS defines the set of casting rules necessary to convert between class types. Column matrices (N x 1), row matrices (1 x N), and numeric structures are treated as vectors.

Effect matrix parameters and HLSL matrix variables can define whether the value is a row-major or column-major matrix; however, the DirectX APIs always treat [**D3DMATRIX**](d3dmatrix.md) and [**D3DXMATRIX**](d3dxmatrix.md) as row-major.

## Parameter Value Modifiers

Parameter modifier annotations add additional information to a parameter so the parameter's data can be interpreted properly. For instance, a vector may need to be expressed with normalized data or a length may be measured in inches. Parameter value modifier annotations express this additional information so that host applications can transform values correctly when data is transferred to an effect parameter.

These are the parameter modifiers:



| Parameter Value Modifier Annotations | Description                                    |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| [SasNormalize](#sasnormalize)        | Specify whether a vector is normalized or not. |
| [SasUnits](#sasunits)                | Specify the units of measure for a parameter.  |



Â 

### SasNormalize

The SasNormalize annotation denotes that the associated parameter should be a normalized value whenever it is assigned. This annotation only affects float2, float3, and float4 parameters.


```
string SasNormalize = "Value";
```



where Value is either True or False.

Here is an example:


```
float3 UpNormal
<
  bool SasNormalize = "True";
>;
```



### SasUnits

The effect parameter data is in the following units:


```
string SasUnits = "Value";
```



where Value is one of the following:



| Measurement Type     | Value        | Description                    |
|----------------------|--------------|--------------------------------|
