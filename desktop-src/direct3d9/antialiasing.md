# Antialiasing (Direct3D 9)

Antialiasing is a technique you can use to reduce the appearance of stair-step pixels when drawing any line that is not exactly horizontal or vertical. In three-dimensional scenes, this artifact is most noticeable on the boundaries between polygons of different colors. Antialiasing effectively blends the pixels at these boundaries to produce a more natural look to the scene.
