# Animation (Direct3D 9 Graphics)

Contains animations referencing a previous frame. It should contain one reference to a frame and at least one set of [**AnimationKey**](animationkey.md) templates. It also can contain an [**AnimationOptions**](animationoptions.md) data object.

``` syntax
template Animation
{
    < 3D82AB4F-62DA-11cf-AB39-0020AF71E433 >
    [...]
} 
```

Where:

-   \[ ... \] - Any .x file template can be used here. This makes the architecture extensible.
