# Shadowing (Direct3D 9)

Stencil buffers are a depth-buffer technique that can be updated as geometry is rendered, and used again as a mask for drawing more geometry. Common effects include mirrors, shadows (an advanced technique), dissolves, and so on. The [ShadowVolume Sample](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Ee418792(v=VS.85).aspx) uses stencil buffers to implement real-time shadows. Additional information is contained in [Two-Sided Stencil (Direct3D 9)](two-sided-stencil.md).
