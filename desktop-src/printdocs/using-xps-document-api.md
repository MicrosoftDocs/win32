# Using XPS Document API

This section describes how to use the [XPS Document API](documents-xps.md) to perform programming tasks.

For examples of how to use the [XPS Document API](documents-xps.md) in a program, see the [XPS Document API Programming Tasks](#xps-document-api-programming-tasks) section.

For information about how to use the XPS Object Model and how it is implemented by the [XPS Document API](documents-xps.md), see [About XPS Document API](about-xps-document-api.md).

## Getting Started with the XPS Document API

Before you start using the XPS Document API, make sure that you are familiar with the following programming topics:<dl>

[COM Programming](/windows/desktop/com/component-object-model--com--portal)  
[Error Handling in COM](/windows/desktop/com/error-handling-in-com)  
</dl>

When using the XPS Document API, you might also want to use the following technologies:<dl>

[DirectWrite](/windows/desktop/DirectWrite/direct-write-portal)  
[XPS Print API](./printing-with-the-xpsprint-api.md)  
[XPS Digital Signature API](xps-digital-signatures.md)  
</dl>

## XPS Document API Programming Tasks

The topics in this section describe how to use the [XPS Document API](documents-xps.md) in a program and demonstrate how to perform some common programming tasks.

The XPS Document API uses collections to work with groups of interfaces. [Working with XPS OM Collection Interfaces](working-with-xps-object-model-collection-interfaces.md) describes how to program with these collections.

The [Common XPS Document Programming Tasks](common-xps-document-tasks.md) include the following:

<dl>

[Initialize an XPS OM](xps-object-model-initialization.md)  
[Create a Blank XPS OM](create-a-blank-xps-om.md)  
[Read an XPS Document into an XPS OM](read-an-xps-document-into-an-xps-om.md)  
[Navigate the XPS OM](navigate-the-xps-om.md)  
[Write Text to an XPS OM](write-text-to-an-xps-om.md)  
[Draw Graphics in an XPS OM](draw-graphics-in-an-xps-om.md)  
[Place Images in an XPS OM](place-images-in-an-xps-om.md)  
[Write an XPS OM to an XPS Document](write-an-xps-om-to-an-xps-document.md)  
[Print an XPS OM](print-an-xps-om.md)  
  
</dl>

The [Advanced XPS Document Programming Tasks](advanced-xps-document-tasks.md) include the following:

<dl>

[Merge XPS Documents](merging-xps-documents.md)  
[Processing XPS Documents in an XPSDrv Filter](processing-xps-documents-in-an-xpsdrv-filter.md)  
</dl>
