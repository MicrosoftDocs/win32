# How To: Print Using the GDI Print API

This topic introduces how to print from a native Windows program using the [GDI Print API](gdi-printing.md).

## Overview

Printing is usually an integral part of a native Windows program, so it is not a feature that you can add easily after you have written the program. When designing a program for Windows 7, you should consider using the [XPS Print API](xps-printing.md) to provide the printing functionality because it provides the most compatibility for the future. Programs that must run on Windows Vista and earlier versions of Windows will most likely use the [GDI Print API](gdi-printing.md) to provide printing functionality. The GDI Print API is also supported in Windows 7, but it is more limited than the XPS Print API.
