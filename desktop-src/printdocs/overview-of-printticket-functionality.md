# Overview of PrintTicket Functionality

This topic is not current. For the most current information, see the [Print Schema Specification](https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/E/C/DECA6E6B-3E81-48E7-B7EF-6D92A547D03C/print-schema-spec-2-0.zip).

The PrintTicket utilizes an XML-based format for expressing device configuration information using the Feature/Option and parameter constructs of the Print Schema Framework. This includes all of the standard element types as well as the extensibility capabilities of the Print Schema Framework. A PrintTicket is assumed to be a self-contained description of how a single page is to be processed. The steps involved in extracting and constructing such a PrintTicket from a particular document format are not covered here.

A PrintTicket can be used to obtain a PrintCapabilities document describing the characteristics of the device for a particular configuration. Alternatively, the PrintTicket can be submitted with a set of rendering instructions to produce a page of output rendered and processed according to the configuration specified in the PrintTicket.
