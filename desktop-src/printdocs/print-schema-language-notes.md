This topic is not current. For the most current information, see the [Print Schema Specification](https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/E/C/DECA6E6B-3E81-48E7-B7EF-6D92A547D03C/print-schema-spec-2-0.zip).

In this specification, the words that are used to define the significance of each requirement are written in uppercase. These words are used in accordance with their definitions in RFC 2119, and their respective meanings are reproduced below:



| Term                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span id="MUST"></span><span id="must"></span>MUST<br/>       | This word, or the adjective REQUIRED, means that the item is an absolute requirement of the specification.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                               |
| <span id="SHOULD"></span><span id="should"></span>SHOULD<br/> | This word, or the adjective RECOMMENDED, means that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore this item, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before choosing a different course.<br/>                                     |
| <span id="MAY"></span><span id="may"></span>MAY<br/>          | This word, or the adjective OPTIONAL, means that this item is truly optional. For example, one implementation may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace or scenario requires it or because it enhances the product. Another implementation may omit the same item.<br/> |
