# Purpose of the PrintTicket

This topic is not current. For the most current information, see the [Print Schema Specification](https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/E/C/DECA6E6B-3E81-48E7-B7EF-6D92A547D03C/print-schema-spec-2-0.zip).

The primary purpose of the PrintTicket is to express device configurations. In contrast to the PrintCapabilities document, which defines all possible configurations the device can assume (the device's configuration space), the PrintTicket's purpose is to define a single specific configuration that is applied to the job object (in this case the page) that is being processed. To promote portability and consistency of configurations, the specific keywords and hierarchy presented in the Print Schema Keywords section are used by both the PrintCapabilities and the PrintTicket technologies. In addition, the [Print Schema Framework](print-schema-framework.md) defines the basic constructs of both technologies, to promote unambiguous, open, and extensible communication of job formatting and PrintCapabilities.
