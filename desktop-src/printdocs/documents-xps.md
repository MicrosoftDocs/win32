# XPS Document API

The XPS Document API is a native Windows API that enables programs to create, read, edit, save, and print XPS documents. The XPS Document API is supported in Windows 7 and later versions of Windows, and can be used in user-mode programs and XPSDrv printer drivers.

The XPS Document API suports both XPS and OpenXPS, and is designed for C++ programmers who are writing native Windows applications. For more information about the Open XPS specification, see [Open XML Paper Specification (OpenXPS)](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-388.htm).
