# Terms Used in the Print Schema

This topic is not current. For the most current information, see the [Print Schema Specification](https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/E/C/DECA6E6B-3E81-48E7-B7EF-6D92A547D03C/print-schema-spec-2-0.zip).

The following list contains terms that are specific to the Print Schema and related technologies.

The standard representation of an XML attribute is *attribute name*="*attribute value*". Although similar, the term "attribute name" must not be confused with the name attribute defined in the Print Schema Framework. The name attribute defined in the Print Schema Framework is a specific instance of an attribute name. <br/>                                                                                                        |

The device performs its task differently in each state. There is a distinct and identifiable difference between the behavior of the device in each of these states. For example, in one state, the media is pulled out of one tray and ends up in another tray. A change in either or both of these trays determines a different state.<br/>                                                                                                                               |

The Option that is designated by either the Print Schema or the PrintCapabilities provider as the Option that is assigned to a Feature when the PrintTicket does not contain an explicit setting for that Feature. Each Feature has a designated default Option.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

A Print Schema Framework-defined construct that represents a specific device configuration attribute. Each Feature instance represents one device attribute. A Feature instance is defined by explicitly defining each of its states.<br/> Identity Option. The Option that has no observable effect when selected; in effect, a "no-op". The result is always the same regardless of the number of times this Option is selected.<br/>                                               |

The location is defined by both the particular element and all ancestors of that element. In other words, location is the equivalent of a fully qualified path in a file system. <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This attribute appears in most of the element types defined in the Print Schema Framework. It identifies and defines instances of each element type. The following two terms refer to name attributes: the Sibling Uniqueness Rule, and the Namespace Convention.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                         |

A Print Schema Framework construct used to represent states that each Feature can assume or be placed in. For example, if the Feature represents media size, typical Option values might be Letter, Legal, A4, among others.<br/> |

There are three Print Schema Framework element types that play roles in parametric input: ParameterDef, ParameterInit, and ParameterRef. A ParameterDef element characterizes a parameter (its range of values, the type of its data, and other characteristics). A ParameterInit element is used to initialize a parameter. A ParameterRef element is used to reference a particular instance of a ParameterInit element.<br/>         |
| <span id="parameterized"></span><span id="PARAMETERIZED"></span>parameterized<br/>                                                                             | Option. An Option instance that contains at least one ScoredProperty element that in turn contains a ParameterRef element rather than a Value element.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Two Option instances are considered to match perfectly if for every ScoredProperty element in one Option instance, there is a corresponding ScoredProperty instance in the other Option instance, and both Value elements of the corresponding ScoredProperty instances are identical.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
