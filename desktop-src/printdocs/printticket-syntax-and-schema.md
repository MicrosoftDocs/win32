# PrintTicket Syntax and Schema

This topic is not current. For the most current information, see the [Print Schema Specification](https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/E/C/DECA6E6B-3E81-48E7-B7EF-6D92A547D03C/print-schema-spec-2-0.zip).

PrintTickets are expressed in the syntax of the XML-based Print Schema Framework. Therefore, the reader should review the [Summary of Element Types](summary-of-element-types.md) for the required syntax.

The PrintTicket Schema closely parallels the Print Schema Framework in terms of the element types used and in the general structure expressed by parent and child elements. Note that ParameterDef elements are not permitted in a PrintTicket, and that ParameterInit elements are permitted only in a PrintTicket.
