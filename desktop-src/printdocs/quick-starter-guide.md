This page is designed to give you a quick start to implement PrintTicket and PrintCapabilities for your application or device driver. Although we encourage that you read the Print Schema specification in full, this page will help give you a jump start in key areas you should pay attention to.

1) Read the [Print Schema-Related Technologies](print-schema-related-technologies.md) to give you an overview of PrintTicket and Print Capabilities technologies

2) Ensure that you have a grasp on the [Summary of Element Types](summary-of-element-types.md) which are used to express Print Schema related technologies.

3) PrintCapabilities documents and PrintTickets are defined at three [Scoping Prefix](scoping-prefix.md) levels, Job, Document and Page.

4) Read over the different [XML Attributes](xml-attributes.md) which are used within different Print Schema element types

5) Review the [PrintCapabilities Document Construction Checklist](printcapabilities-document-construction-checklist.md) and also the provided [PrintCapabilities Document Example](printcapabilities-document-example.md)

6) Review the [PrintTicket Construction Checklists](printticket-construction-checklists.md) and also the provided [PrintTicket Example](printticket-example.md)

7) PrintTicket providers should also review the [PrintTicket Validation Checklist](printticket-validation-checklist.md) to ensure conformance with the PrintSchema specification

8) Review both [User Configurable Elements](user-configurable-elements.md) and [Parameter Definitions](parameter-definitions.md) public Print Schema keywords which may appear in a PrintCapabilities document
