# WM\_POINTERENTER message

Sent to a window when a new pointer enters detection range over the window (hover) or when an existing pointer moves within the boundaries of the window.

A window receives this message through its [**WindowProc**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633573) function.

> \[!Important\]  
> Desktop apps should be DPI aware. If your app is not DPI aware, screen coordinates contained in pointer messages and related structures might appear inaccurate due to DPI virtualization. DPI virtualization provides automatic scaling support to applications that are not DPI aware and is active by default (users can turn it off). For more information, see [Writing High-DPI Win32 Applications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd464660).

 


```C++
#define WM_POINTERENTER                 0x0249
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*wParam* 
</dt> <dd>

Contains the pointer identifier and additonal information. Use the following macros to retrieve specific information in the wParam parameter.

-   [**GET\_POINTERID\_WPARAM**](get-pointerid-wparam.md)(wParam): the pointer identifier.
-   [**IS\_POINTER\_NEW\_WPARAM**](is-pointer-new-wparam.md)(wParam): indicates whether this message is the first message generated by a new pointer entering detection range (hover).
-   [**IS\_POINTER\_INRANGE\_WPARAM**](is-pointer-inrange-wparam.md)(wParam): indicates whether this message was generated by a pointer that has not left detection range. This flag is always set for **WM\_POINTERENTER** messages.
-   [**IS\_POINTER\_INCONTACT\_WPARAM**](is-pointer-incontact-wparam.md)(wParam): a flag that indicates whether this message was generated by a pointer that is in contact. This flag is not set for a pointer in detection range (hover).

</dd> <dt>

*lParam* 
</dt> <dd>

Contains the point location of the pointer.

> [!Note]  
> Because the pointer may make contact with the device over a non-trivial area, this point location may be a simplification of a more complex pointer area. Whenever possible, an application should use the complete pointer area information instead of the point location.

 

Use the following macros to retrieve the physical screen coordinates of the point.

-   [**GET\_X\_LPARAM**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632654)(lParam): the x (horizontal point) coordinate.
-   [**GET\_Y\_LPARAM**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632655)(lParam): the y (vertical point) coordinate.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

If an application processes this message, it should return zero.

If the application does not process this message, it should call [**DefWindowProc**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633572).

## Remarks

The **WM\_POINTERENTER** notification can be used by a window to provide feedback to the user while the pointer is over its surface or to otherwise react to the presence of a pointer over its surface.

This notification is only sent to the window that is receiving input for the pointer. The following table lists some of the situations in which this notification is sent.



| Action                                                   | Flags Set                                                                                                                                         | Notifications Sent To                                 |
|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| A new pointer enters detection range (hover).            | [**IS\_POINTER\_NEW\_WPARAM**](is-pointer-new-wparam.md)<br/> [**IS\_POINTER\_INRANGE\_WPARAM**](is-pointer-inrange-wparam.md)<br/> | Window over which the pointer enters detection range. |
| A hovering pointer crosses within the window boundaries. | [**IS\_POINTER\_INRANGE\_WPARAM**](is-pointer-inrange-wparam.md)<br/>                                                                      | Window within which the pointer has crossed.          |



 

> \[!Important\]  
> When a window loses capture of a pointer and it receives the [**WM\_POINTERCAPTURECHANGED**](wm-pointercapturechanged.md) notification, it typically will not receive any further notifications. For this reason, it is important that you not make any assumptions based on evenly paired [**WM\_POINTERDOWN**](wm-pointerdown.md)/[**WM\_POINTERUP**](wm-pointerup.md) or **WM\_POINTERENTER**/[**WM\_POINTERLEAVE**](wm-pointerleave.md) notifications.

 

When inputs come from the mouse, as a result of mouse and pointer message integration, **WM\_POINTERENTER** is not sent.
