# D3DX Interfaces (Direct3D 11 Graphics)

This section contains reference information for the component object model (COM) interfaces provided by the D3DX utility library.

> [!Note]  
> The D3DX (D3DX 9, D3DX 10, and D3DX 11) utility library is deprecated for Windows 8 and is not supported for Windows Store apps.

It is created by calling [**D3DX11CreateThreadPump**](d3dx11createthreadpump.md). There are several APIs that take an optional thread pump as a parameter, such as [**D3DX11CreateTextureFromFile**](d3dx11createtexturefromfile.md) and [**D3DX11CompileFromFile**](d3dx11compilefromfile.md); if you pass a thread pump interface into these APIs, the functions will execute asynchronously on a separate thread. Particularly on multiprocessor machines, a thread pump can load resources and process data without a noticeable decrease in performance.<br> |
