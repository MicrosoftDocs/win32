| [Introduction to Multithreading in Direct3D 11](overviews-direct3d-11-render-multi-thread-intro.md)<br/>         | Multithreading is designed to improve performance by performing work using one or more threads at the same time. <br/>                                                                                                         |
| [Object Creation with Multithreading](overviews-direct3d-11-render-multi-thread-create.md)<br/>                  | Use the [**ID3D11Device**](/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/nn-d3d11-id3d11device) interface to create resources and objects, use the [**ID3D11DeviceContext**](/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/nn-d3d11-id3d11devicecontext) for [rendering](overviews-direct3d-11-render-multi-thread-render.md).<br/> |
| [Immediate and Deferred Rendering](overviews-direct3d-11-render-multi-thread-render.md)<br/>                     | Direct3D 11 supports two types of rendering: immediate and deferred. Both are implemented by using the [**ID3D11DeviceContext**](/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/nn-d3d11-id3d11devicecontext) interface.<br/>                                                      |
| [Command List](overviews-direct3d-11-render-multi-thread-command-list.md)<br/>                                   | A command list is a sequence of GPU commands that can be recorded and played back. A command list may improve performance by reducing the amount of overhead generated by the runtime.<br/>                                    |
| [Threading Differences between Direct3D Versions](overviews-direct3d-11-render-multi-thread-differences.md)<br/> | Many multi-threaded programming models make use of synchronization primitives (such as mutexes) to create critical sections and prevent code from being accessed by more than one thread at a time.<br/>                       |
