# Types of Resources

Resources are areas in memory that can be accessed by the Direct3D pipeline, they are the building blocks of your scene. Resources contain many types of data such as geometry, textures or shader data that Direct3D uses to populate and render your scene. This topic describes the types of resources from Direct3D 10, as well as new types in Direct3D 11 including structured buffers and writable textures and buffers.

**Note: Differences between Direct3D 11 and Direct3D 10**

Direct3D 11 supports several new resource types including:

<li><a href="direct3d-11-advanced-stages-cs-resources.md">read-write buffers and textures</a></li><li><a href="direct3d-11-advanced-stages-cs-resources.md">structured buffers</a></li><li><a href="direct3d-11-advanced-stages-cs-resources.md">byte-address buffers</a></li><li><a href="direct3d-11-advanced-stages-cs-resources.md">append and consume buffers</a></li><li><a href="direct3d-11-advanced-stages-cs-resources.md">unordered access buffer or texture</a></li></ul>Direct3D 11.2 supports <a href="tiled-resources.md">tiled resources</a>.<br /> Both Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 11 support the <a href="overviews-direct3d-11-resources-buffers-intro.md">buffer</a> and <a href="overviews-direct3d-11-resources-textures-intro.md">texture</a> types that were introduced in Direct3D 10.<br />
