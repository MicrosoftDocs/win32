# Common version interfaces

This section contains information about the common version interfaces.

## In this section

| Topic | Description |
|-|-|
| [**ID3D10Blob**](/windows/win32/api/d3dcommon/nn-d3dcommon-id3d10blob) | This interface is used to return arbitrary-length data. |
| [**ID3DBlob**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ff728743(v=vs.85)) | This interface is used to return data of arbitrary length. |
| [**ID3DDestructionNotifier**](/windows/win32/api/d3dcommon/nn-d3dcommon-id3ddestructionotifier) | Used to register for callbacks when a Direct 3D nano-COM object is destroyed. |
| [**ID3DInclude**](/windows/desktop/api/D3Dcommon/nn-d3dcommon-id3dinclude) | [**ID3DInclude**](/windows/desktop/api/D3Dcommon/nn-d3dcommon-id3dinclude) is an include interface that the user implements to allow an application to call user-overridable methods for opening and closing shader \#include files. |
| [**ID3DUserDefinedAnnotation**](/windows/desktop/api/D3D11_1/nn-d3d11_1-id3duserdefinedannotation) | The [**ID3DUserDefinedAnnotation**](/windows/desktop/api/D3D11_1/nn-d3d11_1-id3duserdefinedannotation) interface enables an application to describe conceptual sections and markers within the application's code flow. An appropriately enabled tool, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Ultimate 2012, can display these sections and markers visually along the tool's Microsoft Direct3D time line, while the tool debugs the application. These visual notes allow users of such a tool to navigate to parts of the time line that are of interest, or to understand what set of Direct3D calls are produced by certain sections of the application's code. |
