# How to Choose a File Type Extension

File types are identified by a file name extension. Before defining a new file type, you should first choose a file name extension.

## Instructions

### Step 1:

Choose a long file name extension that you want to use to identify the file type. For more information, see [File Type Handlers](fa-file-extensions.md).

### Step 2:

Check the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types) MIME database to determine whether the file name extension is already associated with another application.

### Step 3:

Define a MIME type when defining a new public file type, and register it with the IANA.
