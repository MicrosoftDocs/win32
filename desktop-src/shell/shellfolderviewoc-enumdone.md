# ShellFolderViewOC.EnumDone event

Indicates that the [**ShellFolderView**](shellfolderview.md) object has finished enumerating the folder's contents.

## Syntax


```JScript
function EventHandler()
{
    // Code to handle the event.
}

// Set the event property to the handler.
ShellFolderViewOC.EnumDone = EventHandler;
```



## Parameters

This event handler has no parameters.

## Remarks

The [**ShellFolderView**](shellfolderview.md) object must enumerate the contents of a folder before it can display it. With folders that are large or located on a remote system, this process can take as much as several minutes. During this time, an animated flashlight graphic is displayed to indicate to the user that processing is under way. Once the enumeration is complete, the **EnumDone** event is fired and the flashlight graphic is replaced by the contents of the folder.

Provide event handling code for this event as shown here.


```
 
Private Sub object_EnumDone()
    'Event handling code
End Sub
                
```
