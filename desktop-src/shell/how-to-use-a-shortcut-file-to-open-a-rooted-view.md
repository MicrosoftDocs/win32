# How to Open a Rooted View of a Junction Point Through a Shortcut File

You can launch a rooted view of a junction point through a [shortcut file](./links.md) to that junction point.

## Instructions


Set the shortcut file's Target line to Explorer.exe with a /root flag. The exact form of the command depends on the location of the junction point:

-   If the junction point is a subfolder of the Desktop, use:

    ``` syntax
    Explorer.exe /e,/root,::{Extension CLSID}
    ```

-   If the junction point is a file system folder, use:

    ``` syntax
    Explorer.exe /e,/root,[Fully qualified path to the folder]
    ```

-   If the junction point is a subfolder of a system virtual folder, use:

    ``` syntax
    Explorer.exe /e,/root,::{Folder CLSID}\::{Extension CLSID}
    ```

    The system virtual folders that can contain junction points have the following class identifiers (CLSIDs):

    

    | System folder     | Class identifier                       |
    |-------------------|----------------------------------------|
    | My Computer       | {20D04FE0-3AEA-1069-A2D8-08002B30309D} |
    | My Network Places | {208D2C60-3AEA-1069-A2D7-08002B30309D} |
    | Control Panel     | {21EC2020-3AEA-1069-A2DD-08002B30309D} |
    | Internet Explorer | {871C5380-42A0-1069-A2EA-08002B30309D} |
