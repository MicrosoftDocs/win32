# SUBQUERY Argument (The Windows Shell)

A subquery is a saved search file (\*.search-ms) that you can use as a filter for a new query. The results of the subquery are used as the source for the new query. For example, say you have several saved search files that restrict a query by email distribution list: mydepartment.search-ms, teamproject.search-ms, and corporatewide.search-ms. Using the `subquery` argument enables you to limit email searches to any or all of these saved searches.

## Example


```
search:query=vacation&subquery=mydepartment.search-ms
```
