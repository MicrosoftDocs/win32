## Description

This sample shows how to implement a Shell verb using the DropTarget method. This method is preferred for verb implementations that must work on Windows XP. This sample implements a standalone local server Component Object Model (COM) object but it is expected that the verb implementation will be integrated into existing applications. To do so, your main application object registers a class factory for itself. That object implements [**IDropTarget**](/windows/win32/api/oleidl/nn-oleidl-idroptarget) for your application's verbs. Note that COM launches your application if it is not already running but connects to a running instance of your application if one is present.
