## Description

This sample shows how to create a constrained search by using the [**ISearchFolderItemFactory**](/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-isearchfolderitemfactory) interface to construct a folder Shell item (a container) that represents the query. The results are displayed using the file open dialog.
