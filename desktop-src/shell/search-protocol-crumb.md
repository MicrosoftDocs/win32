# CRUMB Argument (The Windows Shell)

The `crumb` argument supports full Advanced Query Syntax (AQS) statements and is especially useful as a means of controlling the scope of a search. In addition to AQS statments, the `crumb` argument can take a special `location` parameter on Windows Vista and `kind` and `store` parameters on Windows XP, as described later in this topic.

This topic contains the following sections:

    -   [Vista Examples](#vista-examples)
    -   [Constants for Common Folders](#constants-for-common-folders)
    -   [Argument Information](#argument-information)

## Crumb Syntax

The crumb syntax is as follows:


```
crumb=<column>:<value>[,<label>][,<column>:<value>[,<label>]]& 
```



The &lt;column&gt; portion is any property in the property system, and the &lt;value&gt; portion is a valid value for that property. The <label> portion is an optional alias for the property that displays as a user interface hint.

### General Examples


```
crumb=System.Author:paolo&
crumb=store:mapi&
crumb=location:c%3a%5cMyVacationPix,Vacation&
```



## Using crumb with Vista (location)

In the crumb parameter, Windows Vista supports full AQS and also the `location` property, which has a special implementation available only on Windows Vista. You can use either an AQS string or the `location` property within a single crumb parameter, but not both. If the crumb parameter includes AQS, everything else in that crumb parameter is ignored.

The `location` property enables you to specify a path to search. Windows Vista can bypass the Indexer and traverse the directory directly if the location is outside the Indexer's crawl scope. Consequently, these searches may be slower than searches that use the Indexer.

When you specify a `location` property, two additional parameters are supported and optional:



| Parameter | Values                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| inclusion | include, exclude        | Specifies whether the query should include or exclude items from that path. "Include" is the default. Windows Vista does not support exclusions without inclusions. (See example) |
| recursion | recursive, nonrecursive | Specifies whether the search should recurse all subfolders starting from the value defined in the location:&lt;value&gt;. "Recursive" is the default.                             |



 

To scope a search using the **search:** protocol, you have different options depending on the target of the scope.

Folder on a local machine:

-   Use AQS (crumb=folder:\<URL-encoded path\>)
-   Use location argument (crumb=location:\<URL-encoded path\>)

Folder on a remote machine/network:

-   Use location argument (crumb=location:\<URL-encoded path\>)

Folder accessed through a known Universal Naming Convention (UNC) protocol handler:

-   Use AQS (crumb=store:\<UNC protocol handler name\>)
-   Use location argument (crumb=location:\<URL-encoded path\>)

### Vista Examples


```
search:query=vacation&crumb=location:shell%3aPersonal,include,recursive&
    
search:crumb=location:c%3a%5cPictures&crumb=location:c%3a%5cPictures%5cDuplicates,,exclude& 
    
search:crumb=location:c%3a%5cDocuments&crumb=kind:pics&
```



The first example executes a search for "vacation" starting at the `shell://Personal` location (a special shortcut to the user's **My Documents** folder), including that folder and all subfolders. See table below.

The second example executes a search within C:\\Pictures, but not in C:\\Pictures\\Duplicates.

The third example executes a search within C:\\Documents, limited to files with the `kind` property set to pics.

### Constants for Common Folders

Windows Vista enables the use of CSIDL values that provide a unique system-independent way to identify special folders used frequently by applications, but which may not have the same name or location on any given system. For example, the system folder may be "C:\\Windows" on one system and "C:\\Winnt" on another.

Use these locations with this syntax:


```
crumb=location:shell%3a<LocationName>&
```



The following table lists the CSIDL values. Refer to [**ShellSpecialFolderConstants**](/windows/desktop/api/Shldisp/ne-shldisp-shellspecialfolderconstants) for more information.
