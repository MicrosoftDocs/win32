# Mobile Computing Configurations

The Synchronization Manager is useful for computers configured as follows:

-   Mobile computer used in a docking station on a high bandwidth network but occasionally used via a dial-in connection.
-   Mobile computer used mostly via a dial-in connection.
-   Desktop computer used strictly via a dial-in connection, such as a computer used by a telecommuter.
-   Desktop computer used strictly via a high bandwidth network.

Although the last case is not a typical mobile scenario, latency issues with network access may make it convenient to cache resources locally. In all these configurations, the application can use the SyncMgr to keep files and other resources cached locally and synchronized between online and offline use.
