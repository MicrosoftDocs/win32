# User Profiles

Configuration information that can be retained for each user is saved in [user profiles](about-user-profiles.md). This information includes the desktop arrangement, personal program groups, program items in the personal program groups, screen colors, screen savers, network connections, printer connections, mouse settings, window size and position, and so on. When a user logs on, the system loads the user's profile and configures the environment according to the information in the profile.

This section includes the following topics.

- [About User Profiles](about-user-profiles.md)
- [User Profiles Reference](user-profiles-reference.md)
