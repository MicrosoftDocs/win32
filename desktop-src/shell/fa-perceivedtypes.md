# Perceived Types

A perceived type is a category of file types that lets you identify your file type to Windows (and applications) as being an image, audio, document, or other type. Perceived types are used for several purposes, including the determination of the folder type, which is then used to set the default view settings. For example, a folder full of files that are of the perceived type image is assigned a default view mode of thumbnails.

## About Perceived Types

Perceived types, defined as PerceivedType values, are similar to file types except that they refer to broad categories of file format types rather than specific file types. For example, image, text, audio, and compressed are perceived types. File types (generally public file types) can be assigned a perceived type, and should always be assigned one whenever there is one that is appropriate. For example, the image file types .bmp, .png, .jpg, and .gif are also of perceived type image.

The default perceived types are as follows:

-   Folder
-   Text
-   Image
-   Audio
-   Video
-   Compressed
-   Document
-   System
-   Application
-   Gamemedia
-   Contacts

## Additional Resources

-   For information about how to register perceived types, see [Application Registration](app-registration.md).
-   For a list of default perceived types, see the [**PERCEIVED**](/windows/desktop/api/Shtypes/ne-shtypes-tagperceived) enumeration.
-   To retrieves a file's perceived type based on its file name extension, see the [**AssocGetPerceivedType**](/windows/desktop/api/Shlwapi/nf-shlwapi-assocgetperceivedtype) function.
