## Description

This method is preferred for verb implementations because it provides the most flexibility, is simple, and supports out-of-process activation. This sample implements a standalone, local server Component Object Model (COM) object, but it is expected that the verb implementation will be integrated into existing applications. To do so, your main application object must register a class factory for itself. That object implements [**IDropTarget**](/windows/win32/api/oleidl/nn-oleidl-idroptarget) for your application's verbs. Note that COM launches your application if it is not already running but connects to a running instance of your application if one is present.
