## Description

CreateProcess-based verbs depend on running a executable and passing it a command-line argument. This method is not as powerful as the DropTarget and ExecuteCommand methods but it does achieve the desirable out-of-process behavior.

## Requirements



| Product                                | Minimum Product Version |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Windows                                | Windows Vista           |
| Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) | 7.0                     |
