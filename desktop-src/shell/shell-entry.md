# Windows Shell

The Windows UI provides users with access to a wide variety of objects necessary for running applications and managing the operating system. The most numerous and familiar of these objects are the folders and files that reside on computer disk drives. There are also a number of virtual objects that allow the user to perform tasks such as sending files to remote printers or accessing the Recycle Bin. The Shell organizes these objects into a hierarchical namespace and provides users and applications with a consistent and efficient way to access and manage objects.

## Shell Development Scenarios

The following development scenarios relate to application development:

-   Extending the Shell, which consists of creating a data source (versus consuming the Shell data model)
-   Implementing a subset of the Shell data source tasks
-   Supporting libraries and item views in Windows Explorer
-   Using the common file dialog
-   Implementing Control Panel items
-   Managing notifications

The following development scenarios relate to file format ownership:

-   Implementing a subset of the Shell data source tasks
-   Implementing any handler
-   Supporting desktop search

The following development scenarios relate to data storage ownership:

-   Supporting desktop search and OpenSearch
-   Implementing a subset of the Shell data source tasks (virtual folders)
-   Supporting libraries in Windows Explorer

The following development scenario relates to device support:

-   Auto run and auto play

## Windows Shell SDK Documentation

This documentation is broken into three major sections:

-   The [Shell Developer's Guide](intro.md) provides conceptual material about how the Shell works and how to use the Shell's API in your application.
-   The [Shell Reference](shell-reference-bumper.md) section documents programming elements that make up the various Shell APIs.
-   [Shell Samples](samples-entry.md) provides links to related code samples.

The following table provides an outline of the Shell Reference section. Unless otherwise noted, all programming elements are documented in unmanaged C++.
