# Logical Operations

A logical operation can be applied between the fragment and the value stored at the corresponding location in the framebuffer; the result replaces the current framebuffer value. You choose the desired logical operation with [**glLogicOp**](gllogicop.md). Logical operations are performed only on color indexes, never on RGBA values.
