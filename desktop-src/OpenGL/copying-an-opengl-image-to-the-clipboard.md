# Copying an OpenGL Image to the Clipboard

Although the current version of the Microsoft implementation of OpenGL in Windows does not directly support the Clipboard, you can copy a Windows OpenGL image to the Clipboard.

**To copy an OpenGL image to the Clipboard**

1.  Draw the image to a memory bitmap or an enhanced metafile.
2.  Copy that bitmap to the Clipboard.
