# OpenGL Utility Library

The OpenGL Utility (GLU) library contains several groups of functions that complement the core OpenGL interface by providing support for auxiliary features. These utility functions make use of core OpenGL functions, so any OpenGL implementation is guaranteed to support the utility functions.

> [!Note]  
> The prefix for Utility library functions is "glu" rather than "gl."

 

Many of these functions are described in preceding sections of the documenation as their topics arise. These functions are listed here for completeness. GLU functions that aren't discussed in preceding sections are described here. For more detailed descriptions of these functions, see the *OpenGL Reference Manual*. This section groups related GLU functions, as follows:

-   [Initializing](initializing.md)
-   [Manipulating Images for Use in Texturing](manipulating-images-for-use-in-texturing.md)
-   [Transforming Coordinates](transforming-coordinates.md)
-   [Tessellating Polygons](tessellating-polygons.md)
-   [Using Callback Functions](using-callback-functions.md)
-   [Using Tessellation Objects](using-tessellation-objects.md)
-   [Specifying Callbacks](specifying-callbacks.md)
-   [Specifying the Polygon to Be Tessellated](specifying-the-polygon-to-be-tessellated.md)
-   [Rendering Simple Surfaces](rendering-simple-surfaces.md)
-   [Using NURBS Curves and Surfaces](using-nurbs-curves-and-surfaces.md)
