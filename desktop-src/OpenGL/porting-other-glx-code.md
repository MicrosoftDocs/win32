# Porting Other GLX Code

In addition to the Xlib and GLX functions described in the preceding sections, your program probably contains some of the other GLX or Xlib functions listed in [Translating the GLX Library](translating-the-glx-library.md). Rewrite your X Window System code to Windows, substituting the appropriate functions.
