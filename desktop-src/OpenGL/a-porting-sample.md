# A Porting Sample

It's easier to understand how to modify your X Window System OpenGL program for Windows if you can compare before and after samples, and you can better see how the translated code is used in the proper context. This section presents an example of an X Window System OpenGL program, and then shows how the program looks after it has been ported to Windows. Note that the OpenGL code is the same in both programs.
