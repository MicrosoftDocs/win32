# Setting Lighting and Coloring

In addition to specifying colors and normal vectors, you can define the desired lighting conditions with [**glLight\***](gllight-functions.md) and [**glLightModel\***](gllightmodel-functions.md), and the desired material properties with [**glMaterial\***](glmaterial-functions.md). Related functions for controlling how lighting calculations are performed include [**glShadeModel**](glshademodel.md), [**glFrontFace**](glfrontface.md), and [**glColorMaterial**](glcolormaterial.md).
