# Porting to OpenGL

OpenGL is designed for compatibility across hardware and operating systems. This design makes it easier for programmers to port OpenGL programs from one system to another. While each operating system has unique requirements, much of the OpenGL code in your current programs can be used as is. To port your OpenGL application to Microsoft Windows, you'll have to modify your programs to work with the Windows windowing systems.

In general applications are ported to OpenGL for Windows from one of two platforms:

-   OpenGL applications developed for the X Window System and the X library (Xlib)
-   IRIS GL applications

For more information, see the following topics:
