# Reading or Copying Pixels

You can read pixels from the framebuffer into memory, encode them in various ways, and store the encoded result in memory with [**glReadPixels**](glreadpixels.md). In addition, you can copy a rectangle of pixel values from one region of the framebuffer to another with [**glCopyPixels**](glcopypixels.md). The function [**glReadBuffer**](glreadbuffer.md) controls which color buffer the pixels are read or copied from.
