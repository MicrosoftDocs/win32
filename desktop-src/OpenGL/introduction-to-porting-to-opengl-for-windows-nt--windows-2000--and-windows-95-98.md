# Introduction to Porting to OpenGL for Windows

The following topics describe how to port your applications from each of these platforms. The topics discuss porting OpenGL and window management code only; there is no discussion of other operating system port issues such as reading files, messaging, thread creation, and so on. This porting guide focuses on specific porting issues and assumes that you have an understanding of OpenGL and Windows programming.
