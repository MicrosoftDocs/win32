# OpenGL Graphic Control

OpenGL provides you with fairly direct control over the fundamental operations of two- and three-dimensional graphics. This includes specification of such parameters as transformation matrices, lighting equation coefficients, antialiasing methods, and pixel-update operators. However, it doesn't provide you with a means for describing or modeling complex geometric objects. Thus, the OpenGL commands you issue specify how a certain result should be produced (what procedure should be followed) rather than what exactly that result should look like. That is, OpenGL is fundamentally procedural rather than descriptive. To fully understand how to use OpenGL, it helps to know the order in which it carries out its operations.
