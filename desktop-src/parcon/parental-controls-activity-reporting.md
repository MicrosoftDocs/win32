# Parental Controls Activity Reporting

Activity reporting is considered essential given social engineering issues. Aware applications or filters are requested to log activities as specified in the Using Parental Controls APIs section.

Clicking the Activity reporting link brings up a Log Viewer page showing all log entries for a maximum one week interval (further bounded by log size limits), with category tree and column format data panes.

The summary box in the upper right of the Parental Controls Panel indicates current status for activity reporting.

Activity events are also visible in the Event Viewer with a name of Microsoft.com/Windows/ParentalControls in the Application Logs.

This functionality depends on the new Event Logging functionality in Windows Vista, using the provided Publishing APIs.
