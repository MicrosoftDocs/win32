# Parental Controls

## Purpose

As part of the Family Safety efforts of Microsoft, Windows provides Parental Controls functionality to monitor and limit exposure of selected computer users to online dangers and inappropriate content.

The Parental Controls technology in Windows is intended to assist diligent parents or guardians in ensuring access to appropriate materials by age or maturity level for those under their guardianship. It provides an extensible infrastructure in addition to built-in capabilities.

## Developer audience

Independent software vendors (ISVs) of products that potentially expose users to safety risks or that are currently working to protect users from such risks are encouraged to integrate Parental Controls.

## Run-time requirements

This functionality was introduced in Windows Vista. Parental Controls functionality is only available on selected consumer operating systems; it is not designed for use with versions of Windows Server. This functionality is not supported in Windows 10.
