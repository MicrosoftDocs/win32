# Parental Controls Robustness

Please note that social engineering issues surrounding enforcing identity-based logins, coupled with practical limits on restrictions designs, generally preclude safety solutions from being robust to children determined to outwit the controls. Microsoft's tenet is that we cannot protect children who make sophisticated intentional efforts to circumvent the restrictions. We can assist in protecting against unintended or unsophisticated intentional access. It is important not to set expectations for parents and guardians too high in parental controls solutions.
