# EAPHost Authenticator Method APIs

The EAPHost Authenticator Method API documentation consists of the following sections.

-   [EAPHost Authenticator Method Functions](eap-host-authenticator-method-functions.md)
-   [EAPHost Authenticator Method Enumerations](eap-host-authenticator-method-enumerations.md)
-   [EAPHost Authenticator Method Structures](eap-host-authenticator-method-structures.md)

Note that these elements must be implemented in a conformant DLL by the author of the EAP authenticator method. The DLL with the implementation of these API elements is loaded and called by the server-side EAPHost.
