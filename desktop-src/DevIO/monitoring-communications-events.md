# Monitoring Communications Events

The following example code opens the serial port for overlapped I/O, creates an event mask to monitor CTS and DSR signals, and then waits for an event to occur. The [**WaitCommEvent**](/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-waitcommevent) function should be executed as an overlapped operation so the other threads of the process can perform I/O operations during the wait.


```C++
#include <windows.h>
#include <tchar.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void _tmain(
            int argc, 
            TCHAR *argv[]
           )
{
    HANDLE hCom;
    OVERLAPPED o;
    BOOL fSuccess;
    DWORD dwEvtMask;

    hCom = CreateFile( TEXT("\\\\.\\COM1"),
        GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE,
        0,    // exclusive access 
        NULL, // default security attributes 
        OPEN_EXISTING,
        FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED,
        NULL 
        );

    if (hCom == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) 
    {
        // Handle the error. 
        printf("CreateFile failed with error %d.\n", GetLastError());
        return;
    }

    // Set the event mask. 

    fSuccess = SetCommMask(hCom, EV_CTS | EV_DSR);

    if (!fSuccess) 
    {
        // Handle the error. 
        printf("SetCommMask failed with error %d.\n", GetLastError());
        return;
    }

    // Create an event object for use by WaitCommEvent. 

    o.hEvent = CreateEvent(
        NULL,   // default security attributes 
        TRUE,   // manual-reset event 
        FALSE,  // not signaled 
        NULL    // no name
         );
    

    // Initialize the rest of the OVERLAPPED structure to zero.
    o.Internal = 0;
    o.InternalHigh = 0;
    o.Offset = 0;
    o.OffsetHigh = 0;

    assert(o.hEvent);

    if (WaitCommEvent(hCom, &dwEvtMask, &o)) 
    {
        if (dwEvtMask & EV_DSR) 
        {
             // To do.
        }

        if (dwEvtMask & EV_CTS) 
        {
            // To do. 
        }
    }
    else
    {
        DWORD dwRet = GetLastError();
        if( ERROR_IO_PENDING == dwRet)
        {
            printf("I/O is pending...\n");

            // To do.
        }
        else 
            printf("Wait failed with error %d.\n", GetLastError());
    }
}
```
