# Device Events (IoEvent.h)

Applications, including services, can register to receive notification of device events. For example, a catalog service can receive notice of volumes being mounted or dismounted so it can adjust the paths to files on the volume. The system notifies an application that a device event has occurred by sending the application a [**WM\_DEVICECHANGE**](wm-devicechange.md) message. The system notifies a service that a device event has occurred by invoking the service's event handler function, [**HandlerEx**](/windows/desktop/api/winsvc/nc-winsvc-lphandler_function_ex).

To receive device event notices, call the [**RegisterDeviceNotification**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-registerdevicenotificationa) function with a [**DEV\_BROADCAST\_HANDLE**](/windows/desktop/api/Dbt/ns-dbt-dev_broadcast_handle) structure. Be sure to set the **dbch\_handle** member to the device handle obtained from the [**CreateFile**](/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea) function. Also, set the **dbch\_devicetype** member to **DBT\_DEVTYP\_HANDLE**. The function returns a device notification handle. Note that this is not the same as the volume handle.

When your application receives notification, if the event type is [DBT\_CUSTOMEVENT](dbt-customevent.md), you may have received one of the device events defined in IoEvent.h. To determine if one of these events has occurred, use the following steps.

1.  Treat the event data as a [**DEV\_BROADCAST\_HDR**](/windows/desktop/api/Dbt/ns-dbt-dev_broadcast_hdr) structure. Verify that the **dbch\_devicetype** member is set to **DBT\_DEVTYP\_HANDLE**.
2.  If **dbch\_devicetype** is **DBT\_DEVTYP\_HANDLE**, the event data is really a pointer to a [**DEV\_BROADCAST\_HANDLE**](/windows/desktop/api/Dbt/ns-dbt-dev_broadcast_handle) structure.
3.  Compare the **dbch\_eventguid** member to the **GUID**s listed in the following table using the [**IsEqualGUID**](/windows/win32/api/guiddef/nf-guiddef-isequalguid) function.

Removable media has been added to the device. The **dbch\_data** member is a pointer to a [**CLASS\_MEDIA\_CHANGE\_CONTEXT**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ns-winioctl-class_media_change_context) structure. The **NewState** member provides status information. For example, a value of **MediaUnavailable** indicates that the media is not available (for example, due to an active recording session).

**Windows XP:** The **dbch\_data** member is a **ULONG** value that represents the number of times that media has been changed since system startup.

**Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP:** This value is not supported.


</dt> </dl> </dd> </dl>

## Remarks

The **GUID\_IO\_VOLUME\_DISMOUNT** and **GUID\_IO\_VOLUME\_DISMOUNT\_FAILED** events are related, as are the **GUID\_IO\_VOLUME\_LOCK** and **GUID\_IO\_VOLUME\_LOCK\_FAILED** event. The **GUID\_IO\_VOLUME\_DISMOUNT** and **GUID\_IO\_VOLUME\_LOCK** events indicate that an operation is being attempted. You should act on the event notification, and record the action taken. The **GUID\_IO\_VOLUME\_DISMOUNT\_FAILED** and **GUID\_IO\_VOLUME\_LOCK\_FAILED** events indicate that the attempted operation failed. You may then use your record to undo the actions you made in response to the operation.

The **dbch\_hdevnotify** member of the [**DEV\_BROADCAST\_HANDLE**](/windows/desktop/api/Dbt/ns-dbt-dev_broadcast_handle) structure indicates the affected device. Note that this is the device notification handle returned by [**RegisterDeviceNotification**](/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-registerdevicenotificationa), not a volume handle. To perform operations on the volume, map this handle to the corresponding volume handle.
