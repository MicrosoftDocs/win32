# DBT\_DEVICEREMOVECOMPLETE event

The system broadcasts the DBT\_DEVICEREMOVECOMPLETE device event when a device or piece of media has been physically removed.

To broadcast this device event, the system uses the [**WM\_DEVICECHANGE**](wm-devicechange.md) message with *wParam* set to DBT\_DEVICEREMOVECOMPLETE and *lParam* set as described following.


```C++
LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProc(
  HWND hwnd,       // handle to window
  UINT uMsg,       // WM_DEVICECHANGE
  WPARAM wParam,   // device-change event
  LPARAM lParam    // event-specific data
);
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*hwnd* 
</dt> <dd>

A handle to a window.

</dd> <dt>

*uMsg* 
</dt> <dd>

The [**WM\_DEVICECHANGE**](wm-devicechange.md) message identifier.

</dd> <dt>

*wParam* 
</dt> <dd>

Set to DBT\_DEVICEREMOVECOMPLETE

</dd> <dt>

*lParam* 
</dt> <dd>

A pointer to a structure identifying the device removed. The structure consists of an event-independent header, followed by event-dependent members that describe the device. To use this structure, treat the structure as a [**DEV\_BROADCAST\_HDR**](/windows/desktop/api/Dbt/ns-dbt-dev_broadcast_hdr) structure, then check its **dbch\_devicetype** member to determine the device type.

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

Return **TRUE**.

## Remarks

The system may broadcast a DBT\_DEVICEREMOVECOMPLETE message without sending corresponding [DBT\_DEVICEQUERYREMOVE](dbt-devicequeryremove.md) and [DBT\_DEVICEREMOVEPENDING](dbt-deviceremovepending.md) messages. In such cases, the applications and drivers must recover from the loss of the device as best they can.

If media is being removed, the type of device arriving is a volume (the **dbch\_devicetype** member is DBT\_DEVTYP\_VOLUME) and the change effects the media (the **dbcv\_flags** member is DBTF\_MEDIA).

## Examples

For an example, see [Detecting Media Insertion or Removal](detecting-media-insertion-or-removal.md) or [Processing a Request to Remove a Device](processing-a-request-to-remove-a-device.md).
