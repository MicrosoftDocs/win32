# About Device Management

The system uses messages to notify applications of device changes and power changes. Device messages notify applications of device change events; power messages notify applications of power management events. Applications and drivers can also define and use custom messages to enable notification of other types of events. This overview provides information on the following topics:

-   [Device Messages](device-messages.md)
-   [Device Event Types](device-event-types.md)
-   [Device Notifications](device-notifications.md)
-   [Device Events](device-events.md)
-   [Device Input and Output Control (IOCTL)](device-input-and-output-control-ioctl-.md)

For more information about power messages, see [Power Management](/windows/desktop/Power/power-management-portal).
