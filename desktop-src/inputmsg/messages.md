The topics in this section provide the reference specifications for specific [Pointer Input Messages and Notifications](messages-and-notifications-portal.md).

## In this section




| Topic | Description | 
|-------|-------------|
| [<strong>DM_POINTERHITTEST</strong>](dm-pointerhittest.md)<br /> | Sent to a window, when pointer input is first detected, in order to determine the most probable input target for [Direct Manipulation](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/directmanipulation/direct-manipulation-portal). <br /> | 
| [<strong>WM_NCPOINTERDOWN</strong>](wm-ncpointerdown.md)<br /> | Posted when a pointer makes contact over the non-client area of a window. The message targets the window over which the pointer makes contact. The pointer is implicitly captured to the window so that the window continues to receive input for the pointer until it breaks contact. <br /> If a window has captured this pointer, this message is not posted. Instead, a [<strong>WM_POINTERDOWN</strong>](wm-pointerdown.md) is posted to the window that has captured this pointer. <br /><blockquote>[!Important]<br />Desktop apps should be DPI aware. If your app is not DPI aware, screen coordinates contained in pointer messages and related structures might appear inaccurate due to DPI virtualization. DPI virtualization provides automatic scaling support to applications that are not DPI aware and is active by default (users can turn it off). For more information, see [Writing High-DPI Win32 Applications](/previous-versions//dd464660(v=vs.85)).</blockquote><br /> | 
| [<strong>WM_NCPOINTERUP</strong>](wm-ncpointerup.md)<br /> | Posted when a pointer that made contact over the non-client area of a window breaks contact. The message targets the window over which the pointer makes contact and the pointer is, at that point, implicitly captured to the window so that the window continues to receive input for the pointer until it breaks contact, including the [<strong>WM_NCPOINTERUP</strong>](wm-ncpointerup.md) notification. <br /> If a window has captured this pointer, this message is not posted. Instead, a [<strong>WM_POINTERUP</strong>](wm-pointerup.md) is posted to the window that has captured this pointer. <br /><blockquote>[!Important]<br />Desktop apps should be DPI aware.

For more information, see [Writing High-DPI Win32 Applications](/previous-versions//dd464660(v=vs.85)).</blockquote><br /> | 
| [<strong>WM_NCPOINTERUPDATE</strong>](wm-ncpointerupdate.md)<br /> | Posted to provide an update on a pointer that made contact over the non-client area of a window or when a hovering uncaptured contact moves over the non-client area of a window. While the pointer is hovering, the message targets whichever window the pointer happens to be over. While the pointer is in contact with the surface, the pointer is implicitly captured to the window over which the pointer made contact and that window continues to receive input for the pointer until it breaks contact. <br /> If a window has captured this pointer, this message is not posted. Instead, a [<strong>WM_POINTERUPDATE</strong>](wm-pointerupdate.md) is posted to the window that has captured this pointer.<br /><blockquote>[!Important]<br />Desktop apps should be DPI aware.

| [<strong>WM_PARENTNOTIFY</strong>](wm-parentnotify.md)<br /> | Sent to a window when a significant action occurs on a descendant window. This message is now extended to include the [<strong>WM_POINTERDOWN</strong>](wm-pointerdown.md) event. When the child window is being created, the system sends [<strong>WM_PARENTNOTIFY</strong>](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/inputmsg/wm-parentnotify) just before the [<strong>CreateWindow</strong>](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-createwindowa) or [<strong>CreateWindowEx</strong>](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-createwindowexa) function that creates the window returns. When the child window is being destroyed, the system sends the message before any processing to destroy the window takes place.<br /> A window receives this message through its [<strong>WindowProc</strong>](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms633573(v=vs.85)) function. <br /><blockquote>[!Important]<br />Desktop apps should be DPI aware. If your app is not DPI aware, screen coordinates contained in pointer messages and related structures might appear inaccurate due to DPI virtualization.

| [<strong>WM_POINTERACTIVATE</strong>](wm-pointeractivate.md)<br /> | Sent to an inactive window when a primary pointer generates a [<strong>WM_POINTERDOWN</strong>](wm-pointerdown.md) over the window. As long as the message remains unhandled, it travels up the parent window chain until it is reaches the top-level window. Applications can respond to this message to specify whether they wish to be activated.<br /> A window receives this message through its [<strong>WindowProc</strong>](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms633573(v=vs.85)) function. <br /> | 
| [<strong>WM_POINTERCAPTURECHANGED</strong>](wm-pointercapturechanged.md)<br /> | Sent to a window that is losing capture of an input pointer.<br /> A window receives this message through its [<strong>WindowProc</strong>](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms633573(v=vs.85)) function.<br /> | 
| [<strong>WM_POINTERDEVICECHANGE</strong>](wm-pointerdevicechange.md)<br /> | Sent to a window when there is a change in the settings of a monitor that has a digitizer attached to it. This message contains information regarding the scaling of the display mode. <br /> | 
| [<strong>WM_POINTERDEVICEINRANGE</strong>](wm-pointerdeviceinrange.md)<br /> | Sent to a window when a pointer device is detected within range of an input digitizer. This message contains information regarding the device and its proximity. <br /> | 
| [<strong>WM_POINTERDEVICEOUTOFRANGE</strong>](wm-pointerdeviceoutofrange.md)<br /> | Sent to a window when a pointer device has departed the range of an input digitizer. This message contains information regarding the device and its proximity. <br /> | 
| [<strong>WM_POINTERDOWN</strong>](wm-pointerdown.md)<br /> | Posted when a pointer makes contact over the client area of a window. This input message targets the window over which the pointer makes contact, and the pointer is implicitly captured to the window so that the window continues to receive input for the pointer until it breaks contact. <br /> A window receives this message through its [<strong>WindowProc</strong>](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms633573(v=vs.85)) function.<br /><blockquote>[!Important]<br />Desktop apps should be DPI aware. If your app is not DPI aware, screen coordinates contained in pointer messages and related structures might appear inaccurate due to DPI virtualization.

For more information, see [Writing High-DPI Win32 Applications](/previous-versions//dd464660(v=vs.85)).</blockquote><br /> | 
| [<strong>WM_POINTERENTER</strong>](wm-pointerenter.md)<br /> | Sent to a window when a new pointer enters detection range over the window (hover) or when an existing pointer moves within the boundaries of the window. <br /> | 
| [<strong>WM_POINTERLEAVE</strong>](wm-pointerleave.md)<br /> | Sent to a window when a pointer leaves detection range over the window (hover) or when a pointer moves outside the boundaries of the window. <br /> | 
| [<strong>WM_POINTERROUTEDAWAY</strong>](wm-pointerroutedaway.md)<br /> | Occurs on the process receiving input when the pointer input is routed to another process.<br /> | 
| [<strong>WM_POINTERROUTEDRELEASED</strong>](wm-pointerroutedreleased.md)<br /> | Sent to all processes (configured for cross-process chaining through [<strong>AddContentWithCrossProcessChaining</strong>](/windows/win32/api/directmanipulation/nf-directmanipulation-idirectmanipulationcompositor2-addcontentwithcrossprocesschaining) and not currently handling pointer input) ever associated with a specific pointer ID, when a [<strong>WM_POINTERUP</strong>](wm-pointerup.md) message is received on the current process. <br /> | 
| [<strong>WM_POINTERROUTEDTO</strong>](wm-pointerroutedto.md)<br /> | Sent when ongoing pointer input, for an existing pointer ID, transitions from one process to another across content configured for cross-process chaining ([<strong>AddContentWithCrossProcessChaining</strong>](/windows/win32/api/directmanipulation/nf-directmanipulation-idirectmanipulationcompositor2-addcontentwithcrossprocesschaining)).<br /> | 
| [<strong>WM_POINTERUP</strong>](wm-pointerup.md)<br /> | Posted when a pointer that made contact over the client area of a window breaks contact. This input message targets the window over which the pointer makes contact and the pointer is, at that point, implicitly captured to the window so that the window continues to receive input messages including the [<strong>WM_POINTERUP</strong>](wm-pointerup.md) notification for the pointer until it breaks contact. <br /> A window receives this message through its [<strong>WindowProc</strong>](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms633573(v=vs.85)) function. <br /><blockquote>[!Important]<br />Desktop apps should be DPI aware.

| [<strong>WM_POINTERUPDATE</strong>](wm-pointerupdate.md)<br /> | Posted to provide an update on a pointer that made contact over the client area of a window or on a hovering uncaptured pointer over the client area of a window. While the pointer is hovering, the message targets whichever window the pointer happens to be over. While the pointer is in contact with the surface, the pointer is implicitly captured to the window over which the pointer made contact and that window continues to receive input for the pointer until it breaks contact. <br /><blockquote>[!Important]<br />Desktop apps should be DPI aware.
