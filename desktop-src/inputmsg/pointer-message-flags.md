# Pointer Message Flags

Values that are used in various pointer macros (see [Macros](macros.md)).

<dl> <dt>

<span id="POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_NEW"></span><span id="pointer_message_flag_new"></span>**POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_NEW**
</dt> <dd> <dl> <dt>

0x00000001
</dt> <dt>



Indicates the arrival of a new pointer.


</dt> </dl> </dd> <dt>

<span id="POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_INRANGE"></span><span id="pointer_message_flag_inrange"></span>**POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_INRANGE**
</dt> <dd> <dl> <dt>

0x00000002
</dt> <dt>



Indicates that this pointer continues to exist. When this flag is not set, it indicates the pointer has left detection range.

This flag is typically not set only when a hovering pointer leaves detection range (**POINTER_FLAG_UPDATE** is set) or when a pointer in contact with a window surface leaves detection range (**POINTER_FLAG_UP** is set).


</dt> </dl> </dd> <dt>

<span id="POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_INCONTACT"></span><span id="pointer_message_flag_incontact"></span>**POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_INCONTACT**
</dt> <dd> <dl> <dt>

0x00000004
</dt> <dt>



Indicates that this pointer is in contact with the digitizer surface. When this flag is not set, it indicates a hovering pointer.


</dt> </dl> </dd> <dt>

<span id="POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_FIRSTBUTTON"></span><span id="pointer_message_flag_firstbutton"></span>**POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_FIRSTBUTTON**
</dt> <dd> <dl> <dt>

0x00000010
</dt> <dt>



Indicates a primary action, analogous to a left mouse button down.

A touch pointer has this flag set when it is in contact with the digitizer surface.

A pen pointer has this flag set when it is in contact with the digitizer surface with no buttons pressed.

A mouse pointer has this flag set when the left mouse button is down.


</dt> </dl> </dd> <dt>

<span id="POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_SECONDBUTTON"></span><span id="pointer_message_flag_secondbutton"></span>**POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_SECONDBUTTON**
</dt> <dd> <dl> <dt>

0x00000020
</dt> <dt>



Indicates a secondary action, analogous to a right mouse button down.

A touch pointer does not use this flag.

A pen pointer has this flag set when it is in contact with the digitizer surface with the pen barrel button pressed.

A mouse pointer has this flag set when the right mouse button is down.


</dt> </dl> </dd> <dt>

<span id="POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_THIRDBUTTON"></span><span id="pointer_message_flag_thirdbutton"></span>**POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_THIRDBUTTON**
</dt> <dd> <dl> <dt>

0x00000040
</dt> <dt>



Analogous to a mouse wheel button down.

A touch pointer does not use this flag.

A pen pointer does not use this flag.

A mouse pointer has this flag set when the mouse wheel button is down.


</dt> </dl> </dd> <dt>

<span id="POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_FOURTHBUTTON"></span><span id="pointer_message_flag_fourthbutton"></span>**POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_FOURTHBUTTON**
</dt> <dd> <dl> <dt>

0x00000080
</dt> <dt>



Analogous to a first extended mouse (XButton1) button down.

A touch pointer does not use this flag.

A pen pointer does not use this flag.

A mouse pointer has this flag set when the first extended mouse (XBUTTON1) button is down.


</dt> </dl> </dd> <dt>

<span id="POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_FIFTHBUTTON"></span><span id="pointer_message_flag_fifthbutton"></span>**POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_FIFTHBUTTON**
</dt> <dd> <dl> <dt>

0x00000100
</dt> <dt>



Analogous to a second extended mouse (XButton2) button down.

A touch pointer does not use this flag.

A pen pointer does not use this flag.

A mouse pointer has this flag set when the second extended mouse (XBUTTON2) button is down.


</dt> </dl> </dd> <dt>

<span id="POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_PRIMARY"></span><span id="pointer_message_flag_primary"></span>**POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_PRIMARY**
</dt> <dd> <dl> <dt>

0x00002000
</dt> <dt>



Indicates that this pointer has been designated as the primary pointer. A primary pointer is a single pointer that can perform actions beyond those available to non-primary pointers. For example, when a primary pointer makes contact with a window s surface, it may provide the window an opportunity to activate by sending it a WM_POINTERACTIVATE message.

The primary pointer is identified from all current user interactions on the system (mouse, touch, pen, and so on). As such, the primary pointer might not be associated with your app. The first contact in a multi-touch interaction is set as the primary pointer. Once a primary pointer is identified, all contacts must be lifted before a new contact can be identified as a primary pointer. For apps that don't process pointer input, only the primary pointer's events are promoted to mouse events.


</dt> </dl> </dd> <dt>

<span id="POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_CONFIDENCE"></span><span id="pointer_message_flag_confidence"></span>**POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_CONFIDENCE**
</dt> <dd> <dl> <dt>

0x00000400
</dt> <dt>



Confidence is a suggestion from the source device about whether the pointer represents an intended or accidental interaction, which is especially relevant for PT_TOUCH pointers where an accidental interaction (such as with the palm of the hand) can trigger input. The presence of this flag indicates that the source device has high confidence that this input is part of an intended interaction.


</dt> </dl> </dd> <dt>

<span id="POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_CANCELED"></span><span id="pointer_message_flag_canceled"></span>**POINTER_MESSAGE_FLAG_CANCELED**
</dt> <dd> <dl> <dt>

0x00000800
</dt> <dt>



Indicates that the pointer is departing in an abnormal manner, such as when the system receives invalid input for the pointer or when a device with active pointers departs abruptly. If the application receiving the input is in a position to do so, it should treat the interaction as not completed and reverse any effects of the concerned pointer.


</dt> </dl> </dd> </dl>

## Remarks

XBUTTON1 and XBUTTON2 are additional buttons used on many mouse devices. They return the same data as standard mouse buttons.
