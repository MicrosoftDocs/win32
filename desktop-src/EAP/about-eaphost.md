# About EAPHost

This topic describes the relationship between the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) and Extensible Authentication Protocol Host. For new EAP method development, see [Extensible Authentication Protocol Host](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa364249).

## EAPHost Framework

EAPHost is considered to be a framework for EAP for two reasons.

-   EAPHost is a Windows infrastructure component that hosts the EAP plug-ins
-   EAPHost implements the EAP protocol as per [RFC 3748](Http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=84063). An EAP authentication consists of the EAP protocol as per [RFC 3748](Http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=84063), and the EAP method-specific aspects of the protocol.
