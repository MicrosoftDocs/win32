# About the Sensor API

The Sensor API provides its functionality through a set of COM interfaces. The Sensor API exposes some of these interfaces, which means you can call methods on them. Other interfaces are defined by the API so that you can implement the methods the Sensor API needs to provide event notifications to your program.
