# The Sensor Collection Object

The sensor collection object contains a group of sensor objects.

Sometimes you will want to work with sensors as a group. For example, you might want to use the sensor manager to discover all available motion sensors. The sensor collection object provides methods for working with a group of sensor objects. You can use the [**ISensorCollection**](/windows/desktop/api/sensorsapi/nn-sensorsapi-isensorcollection) interface to call methods that count, add, remove, and retrieve sensors in the collection.
