# Certificate Request Encoding

In a Microsoft PKI, certificate requests are sent from client computers to certification authorities (CAs) as a binary string that contains a sequence of encoded data structures. The Certificate Enrollment API uses Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) to describe and encode these structures. For the purposes of this documentation, ASN.1 can be conceptually divided into the syntax rules (ISO 8824) that describe the data structures and the encoding rules (ISO 8825) that specify how the data is to be encoded for network transmission. For more information, see the following topics:

-   [Introduction to ASN.1 Syntax and Encoding](about-introduction-to-asn-1-syntax-and-encoding.md)
-   [ASN.1 Type System](about-asn-1-type-system.md)
