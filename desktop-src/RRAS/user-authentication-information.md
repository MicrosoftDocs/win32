# User Authentication Information

The Remote Access Connection Manager service on the client computer sends a user name and password to the RAS server on the remote computer. Before it establishes a connection, the remote server uses this information to authenticate the user. By default, the Remote Access Connection Manager sends the user name and password of the currently logged-on user. The RAS client can use the [**RASDIALPARAMS**](rasdialparams-str.md) structure specified in the [**RasDial**](rasdial.md) call to specify a different user name and password.

If the remote server cannot authenticate the user with the specified information, it can allow the connection operation to enter a [paused state](paused-states.md) to enable the RAS client to collect different authentication data from the user.
