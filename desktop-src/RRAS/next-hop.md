# Next Hop

A next hop is the next router on the path towards a destination. Packets from a source are forwarded to a destination on a hop-by-hop basis.

The address of the router that is the next hop in a route is used to uniquely identify links on a point-to-multipoint interface, where all the links share the same interface index.
