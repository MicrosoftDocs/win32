# Routing and Remote Access Service

## Purpose

Remote Access Service (RAS) can be used to create client applications. These applications display RAS common dialog boxes, manage remote access connections and devices, and manipulate phone-book entries.

The Routing APIs make it possible to create applications to administer the routing capabilities of the operating system.

Developers can use the Routing Protocol APIs to implement routing protocols.

## Developer audience

The Routing and Remote Access Service APIs are designed for use by C/C++ programmers. Programmers should also be familiar with networking concepts.

## Run-time requirements

For more specific information about which operating systems support a particular function, refer to the Requirements sections in the documentation.
