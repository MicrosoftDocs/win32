# Multicast Routing Protocol Scenario

All multicast routing protocols go through three basic phases: startup, operation, and shutdown. The following topics outline a basic set of interactions between a multicast routing protocol and the multicast group manager:

-   [Starting Up a Multicast Routing Protocol](starting-up-a-multicast-routing-protocol.md)
-   [Processing Groups and Callbacks](processing-groups-and-callbacks.md)
-   [Enumerating Groups](enumerating-groups.md)
-   [Shutting Down a Multicast Routing Protocol](shutting-down-a-multicast-routing-protocol.md)
