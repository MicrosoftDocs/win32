# About Routing Protocol Interface

The following documentation describes the integration of third-party routing protocols into the Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS). RRAS is a feature of Windows that acts as a multi-protocol router. RRAS defines the interface between the router manager and the routing protocol. The routing protocol is implemented in a dynamic link library (DLL).

Use this interface to implement routing protocols, such as IGRP, NLSP, and BGP, as user-mode DLLs that work with RRAS.

This documentation describes the following topics:

-   [Adapters](adapters.md)
-   [Interfaces](interfaces.md)
-   [Static and Autostatic Routes](static-and-autostatic-routes.md)
