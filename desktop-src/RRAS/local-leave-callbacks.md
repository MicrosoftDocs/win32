# Local Leave Callbacks

After the multicast group manager is notified by IGMP that there are no more receivers present for a group on an interface, the multicast group manager invokes the [**PMGM\_LOCAL\_LEAVE\_CALLBACK**](pmgm-local-leave-callback.md) callback to the routing protocol on that interface if one exists. This callback notifies the routing protocol of the change.

This callback and the [**PMGM\_LOCAL\_JOIN\_CALLBACK**](pmgm-local-join-callback.md) callback are used to synchronize forwarding between IGMP and routing protocols.
