# Routing Protocols

## Purpose

Developers can use the Routing Protocol APIs to implement routing protocols.

## Developer audience

The Routing APIs are designed for use by C/C++ programmers. Programmers should also be familiar with networking concepts.

## Run-time requirements

Routing Protocols is a server-based technology. All the functionality of Routing Protocols is incorporated into Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2003 and Windows 2000 Server. Routing applications cannot run on client operating systems, such as Windows XP or Windows Vista. For more specific information about which operating systems support a particular function, refer to the Requirements sections in the documentation.
