# Retrieving Route Information

There are three methods used to obtain route information from the routing table manager.

-   Enumerating routes (described in [Enumerating Routing Table Entries](enumerating-routing-table-entries.md)).
-   Searching for specific routes (described in [Finding Specific Information in the Routing Table](finding-specific-information-in-the-routing-table.md)).
-   Retrieving changed destinations (described in [Receiving Notification of Changes](receiving-notification-of-changes.md)).
