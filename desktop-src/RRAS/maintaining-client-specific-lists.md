# Maintaining Client-Specific Lists

RTMv2 provides functions that enable clients to create a private list of routes stored in the routing table. Using this list can be more efficient than enumerating routes from the routing table.

For sample code that shows how to use these functions, see [Use a Client-Specific Route List](use-a-client-specific-route-list.md).
