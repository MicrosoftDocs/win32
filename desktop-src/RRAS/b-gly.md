The best route is an optimal route to a network destination, based on a specified criteria. This concept is based on the fact that there is a certain "cost" involved in taking a route across a network.

The best route to take is the one with the lowest cost, based on a specified criteria. This criteria can include the number of networks crossed, the type of network crossed (for example, public or private), or a monetary or bandwidth limit.
