# About Routing Table Manager Version 2

The following documentation describes the Routing Table Manager Version 2 (RTMv2) technology. The RTMv2 API is a feature of Windows 2000 and later operating systems that you can use to write routing protocols that interact with the routing table manager.

The routing table manager is the central repository of routing information for all routing protocols that operate under the Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS).

RTMv2 is not available for Windows NT version 4.0. Additionally, RTMv2 cannot be used for IPX routing protocols that run on Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000. If you are using IPX or writing routing protocols for Windows NT 4.0, please refer to [About Routing Table Manager Version 1](about-routing-table-manager-version-1.md).
