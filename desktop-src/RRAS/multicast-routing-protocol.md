# Multicast Routing Protocol

A multicast routing protocol is one type of service provider that functions as a client within the framework of the router architecture. The routing architecture is designed to be extended by such router client modules.

A multicast routing protocol manages group membership and controls the path that multicast data takes over the network. Examples of multicast routing protocols include: Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM), Multicast Open Shortest Path First (MOSPF), and Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP). The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is a special multicast routing protocol that acts as an intermediary between hosts and routers.
