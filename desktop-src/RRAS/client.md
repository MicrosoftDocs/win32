# Client

A client of RTMv2 is either an instance of a routing protocol, or a management component that registers and interacts with the routing table manager using the RTMv2 API. Unless otherwise specified, any reference to a routing table manager client refers to a client of RTMv2.

A client must run in the same process as the router manager.
