# Multicast Group

A multicast group is a Class D IP address (that is, in the range of 224.0.0.0- 239.255.255.255). Multicast data that is sent to an address in this range is not destined for a single target. Instead, this data can be received by any host that makes a request to join a specific group. A multicast group is referred to by either the symbol G or g.
