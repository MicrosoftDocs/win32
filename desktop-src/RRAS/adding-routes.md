# Adding Routes

Once a client has discovered a route, the client can add that route to the routing table by calling the [**RtmAddNextHop**](/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmaddnexthop) function.

A client can remove routes from the routing table by calling the [**RtmDeleteRouteToDest**](/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmdeleteroutetodest) function.

For sample code that shows how to use these functions, see [Add and Update Routes Using RtmAddRouteToDest](add-and-update-routes-using-rtmaddroutetodest.md).
