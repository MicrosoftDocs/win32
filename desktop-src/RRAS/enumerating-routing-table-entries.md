# Enumerating Routing Table Entries

The enumeration functions allow a client to retrieve information about a specific type of routing table object (routes, destinations, and next hops). Both routing protocols and administration programs can use these functions to locate specific data.

For sample code that shows how to use these functions, see [Enumerate All Destinations](enumerate-all-destinations.md) and [Enumerate All Routes](enumerate-all-routes.md).
