# DNS Concepts

There are a handful of basic concepts on which the functional structure of DNS operates. These basic concepts range from name space definitions to demarcation of name-resolution responsibility boundaries. Understanding these concepts goes a long way in getting a solid working knowledge of DNS. The following DNS concepts are defined and explained in this section:

-   [Name Space](name-space.md)
-   [DNS Domains](dns-domains.md)
-   [DNS Zones](dns-zones.md)
-   [Root](root.md)
-   [Name Resolution](name-resolution.md)
-   [DNS Servers](dns-servers.md)
-   [DNS Resolvers](dns-resolvers.md)
-   [Resource Records](resource-records.md)
