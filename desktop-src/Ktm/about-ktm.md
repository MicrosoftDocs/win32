# About KTM

Kernel Transaction Manager (KTM) is a transaction management service. It makes transactions available as kernel objects and provides transaction management services to system components such as [Transactional NTFS](/windows/desktop/FileIO/transactional-ntfs-portal) (TxF).

The following topics describe the uses and features of KTM:

-   [What is a Transaction?](what-is-a-transaction.md)
-   [Working With Transactions](programming-model.md)
-   [Writing a Resource Manager](writing-a-resource-manager.md)
-   [Interoperability With Other Windows Features](interoperability-with-other-windows-features.md)
-   [KTM Security and Access Rights](ktm-security-and-access-rights.md)

KTM relies on the [Common Log File System](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/clfs/common-log-file-system-portal) for its operation. CLFS is a logging system that is capable of enabling transactions.
