# DXGI

Microsoft DirectX Graphics Infrastructure (DXGI) handles enumerating graphics adapters, enumerating display modes, selecting buffer formats, sharing resources between processes (such as, between applications and the Desktop Window Manager (DWM)), and presenting rendered frames to a window or monitor for display.

DXGI is used by Direct3D 10, Direct3D 11 and Direct3D 12.

Though most graphics programming is done using Direct3D, you can use DXGI to present frames to a window, monitor, or other graphics component for eventual composition and display. You can also use DXGI to read the contents on a monitor.

This documentation set contains information about programming with DXGI.
