</dt> <dd>

A [*security support provider*](s-gly.md) (SSP) that acts as an application layer between [*Security Support Provider Interface*](s-gly.md) (SSPI) and the other SSPs. When an application calls into SSPI to log on to a network, it can specify an SSP to process the request. If the application specifies Negotiate, Negotiate analyzes the request and picks the best SSP to handle the request based on customer-configured security policy.
