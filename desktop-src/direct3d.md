# Direct3D

Direct3D is a low-level API for drawing primitives with the rendering pipeline, or for performing parallel operations with the compute shader. See the content below for more information.

| Topic | Description |
|-|-|
| [Getting started with Direct3D](/windows/win32/getting-started-with-direct3d) | Discusses Direct3D in more depth, different application models, different versions, rendering, and compute. |
| [Direct3D 12 graphics](/windows/win32/direct3d12/direct3d-12-graphics) | Direct3D 12 provides an API and platform that allows your application to take advantage of the graphics and computing capabilities of PCs equipped with one or more Direct3D 12-compatible GPUs. |
| [Direct3D 11 Graphics](/windows/win32/direct3d11/atoc-dx-graphics-direct3d-11) | You can use Microsoft Direct3D 11 graphics to create 3-D graphics for games and scientific and desktop applications. |
| [DXGI](/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/dx-graphics-dxgi) | DXGI handles enumerating graphics adapters, enumerating display modes, selecting buffer formats, sharing resources between processes, and presenting rendered frames to a window or monitor for display. |
| [HLSL](/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl) | HLSL is the high-level shader language for DirectX. Using HLSL, you can create C-like programmable shaders for the Direct3D pipeline. |
| [DDS](/windows/win32/direct3ddds/dx-graphics-dds) | The DirectDraw surface file format (DDS) supports uncompressed and compressed (DXTn) textures, mipmaps, cube maps, and volume maps. It's supported by DirectXTex, DirectXTK, legacy D3DX, and other DirectX tools. |
