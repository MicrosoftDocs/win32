# Volume Management

The highest level of organization in the file system is the *volume*. A file system resides on a volume. A volume contains at least one *partition*, which is a logical division of a physical disk (for more information, see [Disk Devices and Partitions](disk-devices-and-partitions.md)). A volume that contains data that exists on one partition is called a *simple volume*, and a volume that contains data that exists on more than one partition is called a *multipartition volume*.
