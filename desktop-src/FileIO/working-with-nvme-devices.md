# Working with NVMe drives

**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016

Learn how to work with high-speed NVMe devices from your Windows application. Device access is enabled via **StorNVMe.sys**, the in-box driver first introduced in Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1. It's also available to Windows 7 devices through a KB hot fix. In Windows 10, several new features were introduced, including a pass-through mechanism for vendor-specific NVMe commands and updates to existing IOCTLs.

This topic provides an overview of general-use APIs that you can use to access NVMe drives in Windows 10. It also describes:

-   How to send a vendor-specific NVMe command with [pass-through](#pass-through-mechanism)
-   How to [send an Identify, Get Features, or Get Log Pages command](#protocol-specific-queries) to the NVMe drive
-   How to [obtain temperature information](#temperature-queries) from an NVMe drive
-   How to perform behavior changing commands, such as [setting temperature thresholds](#behavior-changing-commands)

## APIs for working with NVMe drives

You can use the following general-use APIs to access NVMe drives in Windows 10. These APIs can be found in **winioctl.h** for user mode applications, and **ntddstor.h** for kernel mode drivers. For more information about header files, see [Header files](#header-files).

-   [**IOCTL\_STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_COMMAND**](/windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_protocol_command) : Use this IOCTL with the **STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_COMMAND** structure to issue NVMe commands. This IOCTL enables NVMe pass-through and supports the Command Effects log in NVMe. You can use it with vendor-specific commands. For more info, see [Pass-through mechanism](#pass-through-mechanism).

-   [**STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_COMMAND**](/windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ns-winioctl-storage_protocol_command) : This input-buffer structure includes a **ReturnStatus** field that can be used report the following status values.
    -   **STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_STATUS\_PENDING**
    -   **STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_STATUS\_SUCCESS**
    -   **STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_STATUS\_ERROR**
    -   **STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_STATUS\_INVALID\_REQUEST**
    -   **STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_STATUS\_NO\_DEVICE**
    -   **STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_STATUS\_BUSY**
    -   **STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_STATUS\_DATA\_OVERRUN**
    -   **STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_STATUS\_INSUFFICIENT\_RESOURCES**
    -   **STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_STATUS\_NOT\_SUPPORTED**
-   [**IOCTL\_STORAGE\_QUERY\_PROPERTY**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_query_property) : Use this IOCTL with the **STORAGE\_PROPERTY\_QUERY** structure to retrieve device information. For more info, see [Protocol-specific queries](#protocol-specific-queries) and [Temperature queries](#temperature-queries).

-   [**STORAGE\_PROPERTY\_QUERY**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ns-winioctl-storage_property_query) : This structure includes the **PropertyId** and **AdditionalParameters** fields to specify the data to be queried. In the **PropertyId** filed, use the **STORAGE\_PROPERTY\_ID** enumeration to specify the type of data. Use the **AdditionalParameters** field to specify more details, depending on the type of data. For protocol-specific data, use the **STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_SPECIFIC\_DATA** structure in the **AdditionalParameters** field. For temperature data, use the **STORAGE\_TEMPERATURE\_INFO** structure in the **AdditionalParameters** field.
-   [**STORAGE\_PROPERTY\_ID**](/windows/win32/api/winioctl/ne-winioctl-storage_property_id) : This enumeration includes new values that allow **IOCTL\_STORAGE\_QUERY\_PROPERTY** to retrieve protocol-specific and temperature information.

    -   **StorageAdapterProtocolSpecificProperty**: If ProtocolType = ProtocolTypeNvme and DataType = NVMeDataTypeLogPage, callers should request 512 byte chunks of data.
    -   **StorageDeviceProtocolSpecificProperty**

    Use one of these protocol-specific property IDs in combination with **STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_SPECIFIC\_DATA** to retrieve protocol-specific data in the [**STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_DATA\_DESCRIPTOR**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ns-winioctl-storage_protocol_data_descriptor) structure.

    -   **StorageAdapterTemperatureProperty**
    -   **StorageDeviceTemperatureProperty**

    Use one of these temperature property IDs to retrieve temperature data in the [**STORAGE\_TEMPERATURE\_DATA\_DESCRIPTOR**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoctl/ns-winioctl-storage_temperature_data_descriptor) structure.

-   [**STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_SPECIFIC\_DATA**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ns-winioctl-storage_protocol_specific_data) : Retrieve NVMe-specific data when this structure is used for the **AdditionalParameters** field of **STORAGE\_PROPERTY\_QUERY** and a [**STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_NVME\_DATA\_TYPE**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ne-winioctl-storage_protocol_nvme_data_type) enum value is specified. Use one of the following **STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_NVME\_DATA\_TYPE** values in the **DataType** field of the **STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_SPECIFIC\_DATA** structure:

    -   Use **NVMeDataTypeIdentify** to get Identify Controller data or Identify Namespace data.
    -   Use **NVMeDataTypeLogPage** to get log pages (including SMART/health data).
    -   Use **NVMeDataTypeFeature** to get features of the NVMe drive.

-   [**STORAGE\_TEMPERATURE\_INFO**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoctl/ns-winioctl-storage_temperature_info) : This structure is used to hold specific temperature data. It's used in the **STORAGE\_TEMERATURE\_DATA\_DESCRIPTOR** to return the results of a temperature query.

-   [**IOCTL\_STORAGE\_SET\_TEMPERATURE\_THRESHOLD**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_set_temperature_threshold) : Use this IOCTL with the **STORAGE\_TEMPERATURE\_THRESHOLD** structure to set temperature thresholds. For more info, see [Behavior changing commands](#behavior-changing-commands).

-   [**STORAGE\_TEMPERATURE\_THRESHOLD**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoctl/ns-winioctl-storage_temperature_threshold) : This structure is used as an input buffer to specify the temperature threshold. The **OverThreshold** field (boolean) specifies if the **Threshold** field is the over threshold value or not (otherwise, it's the under threshold value).

## Pass-through mechanism

Commands which are not defined in the NVMe specification are the most difficult for the host OS to handle – the host has no insight into the effects that the commands may have on the target device, the exposed infrastructure (namespaces/block sizes), and its behavior.

To better carry such device specific commands through the Windows storage stack, a new pass-through mechanism allows vendor-specific commands to be piped through. This pass-through pipe will also aid in development of management and testing tools. However, this pass-through mechanism requires use of the Command Effects Log. Moreover, StoreNVMe.sys requires all commands, not just pass-through commands, to be described in the Command Effects Log.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> StorNVMe.sys and Storport.sys will block any command to a device if it is not described in the Command Effects Log.

 

### Supporting the Command Effects Log

The Command Effects Log (as described in Commands Supported and Effects, section 5.10.1.5 of [NVMe Specification 1.2](https://nvmexpress.org/specifications)) allows the description of the effects of vendor-specific commands together with specification-defined commands. This facilitates both command support validation as well as command behavior optimization, and therefore should be implemented for the entire set of commands that the device supports. The following conditions describe the result on how the command is sent based on its Command Effects Log entry.

For any specific command described in the Command Effects Log...

**While**:

-   Command Supported (CSUPP) is set to ‘1’ signifying that the command is supported by the controller (Bit 01)

    > [!Note]  
    > When CSUPP is set to ‘0’ (signifying that the command is not supported) the command will be blocked

     

**And if** any of the following is set:

-   Controller Capability Change (CCC) is set to ‘1’ signifying that the command may change controller capabilities (Bit 04)

-   Namespace Inventory Change (NIC) is set to ‘1’ signifying that the command may change the number, or capabilities for multiple namespaces (Bit 03)

-   Namespace Capability Change (NCC) is set to ‘1’ signifying that the command may change the capabilities of a single namespace (Bit 02)

-   Command Submission and Execution (CSE) is set to 001b or 010b, signifying that the command may be submitted when there is no other outstanding command to the same or any namespace, and that another command should not be submitted to the same or any namespace until this command is complete (Bits 18:16)

**Then** the command will be sent as the only command outstanding to the adapter.

**Else if**:

-   Command Submission and Execution (CSE) is set to 001b, signifying that the command may be submitted when there is no other outstanding command to the same namespace, and that another command should not be submitted to the same namespace until this command is complete (Bits 18:16)

**Then** the command will be sent as the only command outstanding to the Logical Unit Number object (LUN).

**Otherwise**, the command is sent with other commands outstanding without inhibition. For example, if a vendor-specific command is sent to the device to retrieve statistical information that is not spec-defined, there should be no risk to changing the device’s behavior or capability to execute I/O commands. Such requests could be serviced in parallel to I/O and no pause-resume would be necessary.

### Using IOCTL\_STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_COMMAND to send commands

Pass-through can be conducted using the [**IOCTL\_STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_COMMAND**](/windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_protocol_command), introduced in Windows 10. This IOCTL was designed to have a similar behavior as the existing SCSI and ATA pass-through IOCTLs, to send an embedded command to the target device. Via this IOCTL, pass-through can be sent to a storage device, including an NVMe drive.

For example, in NVMe, the IOCTL will allow the sending down of the following command codes.

-   Vendor Specific Admin Commands (C0h – FFh)
-   Vendor Specific NVMe Commands (80h – FFh)

As with all other IOCTLs, Use [**DeviceIoControl**](/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-deviceiocontrol) to send the pass-through IOCTL down. The IOCTL is populated using the [**STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_COMMAND**](/windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ns-winioctl-storage_protocol_command) input-buffer structure found in **ntddstor.h**. Populate the **Command** field with the vendor-specific command.


```C++
typedef struct _STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND {

    ULONG   Version;                        // STORAGE_PROTOCOL_STRUCTURE_VERSION
    ULONG   Length;                         // sizeof(STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND)

    STORAGE_PROTOCOL_TYPE  ProtocolType;
    ULONG   Flags;                          // Flags for the request

    ULONG   ReturnStatus;                   // return value
    ULONG   ErrorCode;                      // return value, optional

    ULONG   CommandLength;                  // non-zero value should be set by caller
    ULONG   ErrorInfoLength;                // optional, can be zero
    ULONG   DataToDeviceTransferLength;     // optional, can be zero. Used by WRITE type of request.
    ULONG   DataFromDeviceTransferLength;   // optional, can be zero. Used by READ type of request.

    ULONG   TimeOutValue;                   // in unit of seconds

    ULONG   ErrorInfoOffset;                // offsets need to be pointer aligned
    ULONG   DataToDeviceBufferOffset;       // offsets need to be pointer aligned
    ULONG   DataFromDeviceBufferOffset;     // offsets need to be pointer aligned

    ULONG   CommandSpecific;                // optional information passed along with Command.
    ULONG   Reserved0;

    ULONG   FixedProtocolReturnData;        // return data, optional. Some protocol, such as NVMe, may return a small amount data (DWORD0 from completion queue entry) without the need of separate device data transfer.
    ULONG   Reserved1[3];

    _Field_size_bytes_full_(CommandLength) UCHAR Command[ANYSIZE_ARRAY];

} STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND, *PSTORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND;
```



The vendor specific command desired to be sent should be populated in the highlighted field above. Note again that the Command Effects Log must be implemented for pass-through commands. In particular, these commands need to be reported as supported in the Command Effects Log (see previous section for more information). Also note that PRP fields are driver specific thus applications sending commands can leave them as 0.

Finally, this pass-through IOCTL is intended for sending vendor-specific commands. To send other admin or non-vendor specific NVMe commands such as Identify, this pass-through IOCTL should not be used. For example, **IOCTL\_STORAGE\_QUERY\_PROPERTY** should be used for Identify or Get Log Pages. For more info, see the next section, [Protocol-specific queries](/windows).

### Don't update firmware through the pass-through mechanism

Firmware download and activation commands should not be sent using pass-through. **IOCTL\_STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_COMMAND** should only be used for vendor-specific commands.

Instead, use the following general storage IOCTLs (introduced in Windows 10) to avoid applications directly using the SCSI\_miniport version of the Firmware IOCTL. Storage drivers will translate the IOCTL to either a SCSI command or the SCSI\_miniport version of the IOCTL to the miniport.

These IOCTLs are recommended for developing firmware upgrade tools in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016:

-   [**IOCTL\_STORAGE\_FIRMWARE\_GET\_INFO**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_firmware_get_info)
-   [**IOCTL\_STORAGE\_FIRMWARE\_DOWNLOAD**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_firmware_download)
-   [**IOCTL\_STORAGE\_FIRMWARE\_ACTIVATE**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_firmware_activate)

For getting storage information and updating firmware, Windows also supports PowerShell cmdlets for doing this quickly:

-   `Get-StorageFirmwareInfo`
-   `Update-StorageFirmware `

> [!Note]  
> To update firmware on NVMe in Windows 8.1, use IOCTL\_SCSI\_MINIPORT\_FIRMWARE. This IOCTL was not backported to Windows 7. For more information, see [Upgrading Firmware for an NVMe Device in Windows 8.1](/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/upgrading-firmware-for-an-nvme-device).

 

### Returning errors through the pass-through mechanism

Similar to SCSI and ATA pass-through IOCTLs, when a command/request is sent to the miniport or device, the IOCTL returns if it was successful or not. In the [**STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_COMMAND**](/windows/desktop/api/winioctl/ns-winioctl-storage_protocol_command) structure, the IOCTL returns the status through the **ReturnStatus** field.

### Example: sending a vendor-specific command

In this example, an arbitrary vendor-specific command (0xFF) is sent via pass-through to an NVMe drive. The following code allocates a buffer, initializes a query, and then sends the command down to the device via DeviceIoControl.


```C++
    ZeroMemory(buffer, bufferLength);  
    protocolCommand = (PSTORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND)buffer;  

    protocolCommand->Version = STORAGE_PROTOCOL_STRUCTURE_VERSION;  
    protocolCommand->Length = sizeof(STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND);  
    protocolCommand->ProtocolType = ProtocolTypeNvme;  
    protocolCommand->Flags = STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND_FLAG_ADAPTER_REQUEST;  
    protocolCommand->CommandLength = STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND_LENGTH_NVME;  
    protocolCommand->ErrorInfoLength = sizeof(NVME_ERROR_INFO_LOG);  
    protocolCommand->DataFromDeviceTransferLength = 4096;  
    protocolCommand->TimeOutValue = 10;  
    protocolCommand->ErrorInfoOffset = FIELD_OFFSET(STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND, Command) + STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND_LENGTH_NVME;  
    protocolCommand->DataFromDeviceBufferOffset = protocolCommand->ErrorInfoOffset + protocolCommand->ErrorInfoLength;  
    protocolCommand->CommandSpecific = STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_NVME_ADMIN_COMMAND;  

    command = (PNVME_COMMAND)protocolCommand->Command;  

    command->CDW0.OPC = 0xFF;  
    command->u.GENERAL.CDW10 = 0xto_fill_in;  
    command->u.GENERAL.CDW12 = 0xto_fill_in;  
    command->u.GENERAL.CDW13 = 0xto_fill_in;  

    //  
    // Send request down.  
    //  

    result = DeviceIoControl(DeviceList[DeviceIndex].Handle,  
                             IOCTL_STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND,  
                             buffer,  
                             bufferLength,  
                             buffer,  
                             bufferLength,  
                             &returnedLength,  
                             NULL 
                             );  
```



In this example, we expect `protocolCommand->ReturnStatus == STORAGE_PROTOCOL_STATUS_SUCCESS` if the command succeeded to the device.

## Protocol-specific queries

Windows 8.1 introduced [**IOCTL\_STORAGE\_QUERY\_PROPERTY**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_query_property) for data retrieval. In Windows 10, the IOCTL was enhanced to support commonly requested NVMe features such as **Get Log Pages**, **Get Features**, and **Identify**. This allows for the retrieval of NVMe specific information for monitoring and inventory purposes.

The input buffer for the IOCTL, [**STORAGE\_PROPERTY\_QUERY**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ns-winioctl-storage_property_query) (from Windows 10) is shown here.


```C++
typedef struct _STORAGE_PROPERTY_QUERY {
    STORAGE_PROPERTY_ID PropertyId;
    STORAGE_QUERY_TYPE QueryType;
    UCHAR  AdditionalParameters[1];
} STORAGE_PROPERTY_QUERY, *PSTORAGE_PROPERTY_QUERY;
```



When using [**IOCTL\_STORAGE\_QUERY\_PROPERTY**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_query_property) to retrieve NVMe protocol-specific information in the [**STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_DATA\_DESCRIPTOR**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ns-winioctl-storage_protocol_data_descriptor), configure the [**STORAGE\_PROPERTY\_QUERY**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ns-winioctl-storage_property_query) structure as follows:

-   Allocate a buffer that can contains both a [**STORAGE\_PROPERTY\_QUERY**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ns-winioctl-storage_property_query) and a [**STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_SPECIFIC\_DATA**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ns-winioctl-storage_protocol_specific_data) structure.

-   Set the **PropertyID** field to **StorageAdapterProtocolSpecificProperty** or **StorageDeviceProtocolSpecificProperty** for a controller or device/namespace request, respectively.

-   Set the **QueryType** field to **PropertyStandardQuery**.

-   Fill the [**STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_SPECIFIC\_DATA**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ns-winioctl-storage_protocol_specific_data) structure with the desired values. The start of the **STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_SPECIFIC\_DATA** is the **AdditionalParameters** field of [**STORAGE\_PROPERTY\_QUERY**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ns-winioctl-storage_property_query).

The [**STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_SPECIFIC\_DATA**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ns-winioctl-storage_protocol_specific_data) structure (from Windows 10) is shown here.


```C++
typedef struct _STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA {

    STORAGE_PROTOCOL_TYPE ProtocolType;
    ULONG   DataType;                 

    ULONG   ProtocolDataRequestValue;
    ULONG   ProtocolDataRequestSubValue;

    ULONG   ProtocolDataOffset;         
    ULONG   ProtocolDataLength;

    ULONG   FixedProtocolReturnData;   
    ULONG   Reserved[3];

} STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA, *PSTORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA;
```



To specify a type of NVMe protocol-specific information, configure the [**STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_SPECIFIC\_DATA**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ns-winioctl-storage_protocol_specific_data) structure as follows:

-   Set the **ProtocolType** field to **ProtocolTypeNVMe**.

-   Set the **DataType** field to an enumeration value defined by [**STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_NVME\_DATA\_TYPE**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ne-winioctl-storage_protocol_nvme_data_type):

    -   Use **NVMeDataTypeIdentify** to get Identify Controller data or Identify Namespace data.
    -   Use **NVMeDataTypeLogPage** to get log pages (including SMART/health data).
    -   Use **NVMeDataTypeFeature** to get features of the NVMe drive.

When **ProtocolTypeNVMe** is used as the **ProtocolType**, queries for protocol-specific information can be retrieved in parallel with other I/O on the NVMe drive.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For an [**IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY**](/windows/win32/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_query_property) that uses a **STORAGE_PROPERTY_ID** of [**StorageAdapterProtocolSpecificProperty**](/windows/win32/api/winioctl/ne-winioctl-storage_property_id), and whose [**STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA**](/windows/win32/api/winioctl/ns-winioctl-storage_protocol_specific_data) or [**STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA_EXT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddstor/ns-ntddstor-storage_protocol_specific_data_ext) structure is set to `ProtocolType=ProtocolTypeNvme` and `DataType=NVMeDataTypeLogPage`, set the ProtocolDataLength member of that same structure to a minimum value of 512 (bytes).


The following examples demonstrate NVMe protocol-specific queries.

### Example: NVMe Identify query

In this example, the **Identify** request is sent to an NVMe drive. The following code initializes the query data structure and then sends the command down to the device via DeviceIoControl.


```C++
    BOOL    result;
    PVOID   buffer = NULL;
    ULONG   bufferLength = 0;
    ULONG   returnedLength = 0;

    PSTORAGE_PROPERTY_QUERY query = NULL;
    PSTORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA protocolData = NULL;
    PSTORAGE_PROTOCOL_DATA_DESCRIPTOR protocolDataDescr = NULL;

    //
    // Allocate buffer for use.
    //
    bufferLength = FIELD_OFFSET(STORAGE_PROPERTY_QUERY, AdditionalParameters) + sizeof(STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA) + NVME_MAX_LOG_SIZE;
    buffer = malloc(bufferLength);

    if (buffer == NULL) {
        _tprintf(_T("DeviceNVMeQueryProtocolDataTest: allocate buffer failed, exit.\n"));
        goto exit;
    }

    //
    // Initialize query data structure to get Identify Controller Data.
    //
    ZeroMemory(buffer, bufferLength);

    query = (PSTORAGE_PROPERTY_QUERY)buffer;
    protocolDataDescr = (PSTORAGE_PROTOCOL_DATA_DESCRIPTOR)buffer;
    protocolData = (PSTORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA)query->AdditionalParameters;

    query->PropertyId = StorageAdapterProtocolSpecificProperty;
    query->QueryType = PropertyStandardQuery;

    protocolData->ProtocolType = ProtocolTypeNvme;
    protocolData->DataType = NVMeDataTypeIdentify;
    protocolData->ProtocolDataRequestValue = NVME_IDENTIFY_CNS_CONTROLLER;
    protocolData->ProtocolDataRequestSubValue = 0;
    protocolData->ProtocolDataOffset = sizeof(STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA);
    protocolData->ProtocolDataLength = NVME_MAX_LOG_SIZE;

    //
    // Send request down.
    //
    result = DeviceIoControl(DeviceList[Index].Handle,
                             IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY,
                             buffer,
                             bufferLength,
                             buffer,
                             bufferLength,
                             &returnedLength,
                             NULL
                             );

    ZeroMemory(buffer, bufferLength);
    query = (PSTORAGE_PROPERTY_QUERY)buffer;  
    protocolDataDescr = (PSTORAGE_PROTOCOL_DATA_DESCRIPTOR)buffer;  
    protocolData = (PSTORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA)query->AdditionalParameters;  

    query->PropertyId = StorageDeviceProtocolSpecificProperty;  
    query->QueryType = PropertyStandardQuery;  

    protocolData->ProtocolType = ProtocolTypeNvme;  
    protocolData->DataType = NVMeDataTypeLogPage;  
    protocolData->ProtocolDataRequestValue = NVME_LOG_PAGE_HEALTH_INFO;  
    protocolData->ProtocolDataRequestSubValue = 0;  
    protocolData->ProtocolDataOffset = sizeof(STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA);  
    protocolData->ProtocolDataLength = sizeof(NVME_HEALTH_INFO_LOG);  

    //  
    // Send request down.  
    //  
    result = DeviceIoControl(DeviceList[Index].Handle,  
                             IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY,  
                             buffer,  
                             bufferLength,  
                             buffer, 
                             bufferLength,  
                             &returnedLength,  
                             NULL  
                             );  

    //
    // Validate the returned data.
    //
    if ((protocolDataDescr->Version != sizeof(STORAGE_PROTOCOL_DATA_DESCRIPTOR)) ||
        (protocolDataDescr->Size != sizeof(STORAGE_PROTOCOL_DATA_DESCRIPTOR))) {
        _tprintf(_T("DeviceNVMeQueryProtocolDataTest: Get Identify Controller Data - data descriptor header not valid.\n"));
        return;
    }

    protocolData = &protocolDataDescr->ProtocolSpecificData;

    if ((protocolData->ProtocolDataOffset < sizeof(STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA)) ||
        (protocolData->ProtocolDataLength < NVME_MAX_LOG_SIZE)) {
        _tprintf(_T("DeviceNVMeQueryProtocolDataTest: Get Identify Controller Data - ProtocolData Offset/Length not valid.\n"));
        goto exit;
    }

    //
    // Identify Controller Data 
    //
    {
        PNVME_IDENTIFY_CONTROLLER_DATA identifyControllerData = (PNVME_IDENTIFY_CONTROLLER_DATA)((PCHAR)protocolData + protocolData->ProtocolDataOffset);

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For an [**IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY**](/windows/win32/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_query_property) that uses a **STORAGE_PROPERTY_ID** of [**StorageAdapterProtocolSpecificProperty**](/windows/win32/api/winioctl/ne-winioctl-storage_property_id), and whose [**STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA**](/windows/win32/api/winioctl/ns-winioctl-storage_protocol_specific_data) or [**STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA_EXT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddstor/ns-ntddstor-storage_protocol_specific_data_ext) structure is set to `ProtocolType=ProtocolTypeNvme` and `DataType=NVMeDataTypeLogPage`, set the ProtocolDataLength member of that same structure to a minimum value of 512 (bytes).


Note that the caller needs to allocate a single buffer containing STORAGE\_PROPERTY\_QUERY and the size of STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_SPECIFIC\_DATA. In this example, it’s using the same buffer for input and output from the property query. That’s why the buffer that was allocated has a size of “FIELD\_OFFSET(STORAGE\_PROPERTY\_QUERY, AdditionalParameters) + sizeof(STORAGE\_PROTOCOL\_SPECIFIC\_DATA) + NVME\_MAX\_LOG\_SIZE”. Although separate buffers could be allocated for both input and output, we recommend using a single buffer to query NVMe related-information.

### Example: NVMe Get Log Pages query

In this example, based off of the previous one, the **Get Log Pages** request is sent to an NVMe drive. The following code prepares the query data structure and then sends the command down to the device via DeviceIoControl.


```C++
    ZeroMemory(buffer, bufferLength);  

    query = (PSTORAGE_PROPERTY_QUERY)buffer;  
    protocolDataDescr = (PSTORAGE_PROTOCOL_DATA_DESCRIPTOR)buffer;  
    protocolData = (PSTORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA)query->AdditionalParameters;  

    query->PropertyId = StorageDeviceProtocolSpecificProperty;  
    query->QueryType = PropertyStandardQuery;  

    protocolData->ProtocolType = ProtocolTypeNvme;  
    protocolData->DataType = NVMeDataTypeLogPage;  
    protocolData->ProtocolDataRequestValue = NVME_LOG_PAGE_HEALTH_INFO;  
    protocolData->ProtocolDataRequestSubValue = 0;  // This will be passed as the lower 32 bit of log page offset if controller supports extended data for the Get Log Page.
    protocolData->ProtocolDataRequestSubValue2 = 0; // This will be passed as the higher 32 bit of log page offset if controller supports extended data for the Get Log Page.
    protocolData->ProtocolDataRequestSubValue3 = 0; // This will be passed as Log Specific Identifier in CDW11.
    protocolData->ProtocolDataRequestSubValue4 = 0; // This will map to STORAGE_PROTOCOL_DATA_SUBVALUE_GET_LOG_PAGE definition, then user can pass Retain Asynchronous Event, Log Specific Field.

    protocolData->ProtocolDataOffset = sizeof(STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA);  
    protocolData->ProtocolDataLength = sizeof(NVME_HEALTH_INFO_LOG);  

    //  
    // Send request down.  
    //  
    result = DeviceIoControl(DeviceList[Index].Handle,  
                             IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY,  
                             buffer,  
                             bufferLength,  
                             buffer, 
                             bufferLength,  
                             &returnedLength,  
                             NULL  
                             );  

    if (!result || (returnedLength == 0)) {
        _tprintf(_T("DeviceNVMeQueryProtocolDataTest: SMART/Health Information Log failed. Error Code %d.\n"), GetLastError());
        goto exit;
    }

    //
    // Validate the returned data.
    //
    if ((protocolDataDescr->Version != sizeof(STORAGE_PROTOCOL_DATA_DESCRIPTOR)) ||
        (protocolDataDescr->Size != sizeof(STORAGE_PROTOCOL_DATA_DESCRIPTOR))) {
        _tprintf(_T("DeviceNVMeQueryProtocolDataTest: SMART/Health Information Log - data descriptor header not valid.\n"));
        return;
    }

    protocolData = &protocolDataDescr->ProtocolSpecificData;

    if ((protocolData->ProtocolDataOffset < sizeof(STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA)) ||
        (protocolData->ProtocolDataLength < sizeof(NVME_HEALTH_INFO_LOG))) {
        _tprintf(_T("DeviceNVMeQueryProtocolDataTest: SMART/Health Information Log - ProtocolData Offset/Length not valid.\n"));
        goto exit;
    }

    //
    // SMART/Health Information Log Data 
    //
    {
        PNVME_HEALTH_INFO_LOG smartInfo = (PNVME_HEALTH_INFO_LOG)((PCHAR)protocolData + protocolData->ProtocolDataOffset);

        _tprintf(_T("DeviceNVMeQueryProtocolDataTest: SMART/Health Information Log Data - Temperature %d.\n"), ((ULONG)smartInfo->Temperature[1] << 8 | smartInfo->Temperature[0]) - 273);

        _tprintf(_T("DeviceNVMeQueryProtocolDataTest: ***SMART/Health Information Log succeeded***.\n"));
    }

```



### Example: NVMe Get Features query

In this example, based off of the previous one, the **Get Features** request is sent to an NVMe drive. The following code prepares the query data structure and then sends the command down to the device via DeviceIoControl.


```C++
    //  
    // Initialize query data structure to Volatile Cache feature.  
    //  

    ZeroMemory(buffer, bufferLength);  


    query = (PSTORAGE_PROPERTY_QUERY)buffer;  
    protocolDataDescr = (PSTORAGE_PROTOCOL_DATA_DESCRIPTOR)buffer;  
    protocolData = (PSTORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA)query->AdditionalParameters;  

    query->PropertyId = StorageDeviceProtocolSpecificProperty;  
    query->QueryType = PropertyStandardQuery;  

    protocolData->ProtocolType = ProtocolTypeNvme;  
    protocolData->DataType = NVMeDataTypeFeature;  
    protocolData->ProtocolDataRequestValue = NVME_FEATURE_VOLATILE_WRITE_CACHE;  
    protocolData->ProtocolDataRequestSubValue = 0;  
    protocolData->ProtocolDataOffset = 0;  
    protocolData->ProtocolDataLength = 0;  

    //  
    // Send request down.  
    //  

    result = DeviceIoControl(DeviceList[Index].Handle,  
                             IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY,  
                             buffer,  
                             bufferLength,  
                             buffer,  
                             bufferLength,  
                             &returnedLength,  
                             NULL  
                             );  

    if (!result || (returnedLength == 0)) {  
        _tprintf(_T("DeviceNVMeQueryProtocolDataTest: Get Feature - Volatile Cache failed. Error Code %d.\n"), GetLastError());  
        goto exit;  
    }  

    //  
    // Validate the returned data.  
    //  

    if ((protocolDataDescr->Version != sizeof(STORAGE_PROTOCOL_DATA_DESCRIPTOR)) ||  
        (protocolDataDescr->Size != sizeof(STORAGE_PROTOCOL_DATA_DESCRIPTOR))) {  
        _tprintf(_T("DeviceNVMeQueryProtocolDataTest: Get Feature - Volatile Cache  - data descriptor header not valid.\n"));  
        return;                                           
    }  

    //
    // Volatile Cache 
    //
    {
        _tprintf(_T("DeviceNVMeQueryProtocolDataTest: Get Feature - Volatile Cache - %x.\n"), protocolDataDescr->ProtocolSpecificData.FixedProtocolReturnData);

        _tprintf(_T("DeviceNVMeQueryProtocolDataTest: ***Get Feature - Volatile Cache succeeded***.\n"));
    }
```
## Protocol-specific set

From Windows 10 19H1, the IOCTL_STORAGE_SET_PROPERTY was enhanced to support NVMe Set Features.

The input buffer for the IOCTL_STORAGE_SET_PROPERTY is shown here:

```C++
typedef struct _STORAGE_PROPERTY_SET {

    //
    // ID of the property being retrieved
    //

    STORAGE_PROPERTY_ID PropertyId;

    //
    // Flags indicating the type of set property being performed
    //

    STORAGE_SET_TYPE SetType;

    //
    // Space for additional parameters if necessary
    //

    UCHAR AdditionalParameters[1];

} STORAGE_PROPERTY_SET, *PSTORAGE_PROPERTY_SET;
```

When using IOCTL_STORAGE_SET_PROPERTY to set NVMe feature, configure the STORAGE_PROPERTY_SET structure as follows:

-	Allocate a buffer that can contains both a STORAGE_PROPERTY_SET and a STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA_EXT structure;
-	Set the PropertyID field to StorageAdapterProtocolSpecificProperty or StorageDeviceProtocolSpecificProperty for a controller or device/namespace request, respectively.
-	Fill the STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA_EXT structure with the desired values. The start of the STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA_EXT is the AdditionalParameters field of STORAGE_PROPERTY_SET.

The STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA_EXT structure is shown here.

```C++
typedef struct _STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA_EXT {

    STORAGE_PROTOCOL_TYPE ProtocolType;
    ULONG   DataType;                   // The value will be protocol specific, as defined in STORAGE_PROTOCOL_NVME_DATA_TYPE or STORAGE_PROTOCOL_ATA_DATA_TYPE.

    ULONG   ProtocolDataValue;
    ULONG   ProtocolDataSubValue;      // Data sub request value

    ULONG   ProtocolDataOffset;         // The offset of data buffer is from beginning of this data structure.
    ULONG   ProtocolDataLength;

    ULONG   FixedProtocolReturnData;
    ULONG   ProtocolDataSubValue2;     // First additional data sub request value

    ULONG   ProtocolDataSubValue3;     // Second additional data sub request value
    ULONG   ProtocolDataSubValue4;     // Third additional data sub request value

    ULONG   ProtocolDataSubValue5;     // Fourth additional data sub request value
    ULONG   Reserved[5];
} STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA_EXT, *PSTORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA_EXT;
```

To specify a type of NVMe feature to set, configure the STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA_EXT structure as follows:
-	Set the ProtocolType field to ProtocolTypeNvme;
-	Set the DataType field to the enumeration value NVMeDataTypeFeature defined by STORAGE_PROTOCOL_NVME_DATA_TYPE;

The following examples demonstrate NVMe feature set.

### Example: NVMe Set Features

In this example, the Set Features request is sent to an NVMe drive. The following code prepares the set data structure and then sends the command down to the device via DeviceIoControl.

```C++
            PSTORAGE_PROPERTY_SET                   setProperty = NULL;
            PSTORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA_EXT     protocolData = NULL;
            PSTORAGE_PROTOCOL_DATA_DESCRIPTOR_EXT   protocolDataDescr = NULL;

            //
            // Allocate buffer for use.
            //
            bufferLength = FIELD_OFFSET(STORAGE_PROPERTY_SET, AdditionalParameters) + sizeof(STORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA_EXT);
            bufferLength += NVME_MAX_LOG_SIZE;

            buffer = new UCHAR[bufferLength];

            //
            // Initialize query data structure to get the desired log page.
            //
            ZeroMemory(buffer, bufferLength);

            setProperty = (PSTORAGE_PROPERTY_SET)buffer;

            setProperty->PropertyId = StorageAdapterProtocolSpecificProperty;
            setProperty->SetType = PropertyStandardSet;

            protocolData = (PSTORAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFIC_DATA_EXT)setProperty->AdditionalParameters;

            protocolData->ProtocolType = ProtocolTypeNvme;
            protocolData->DataType = NVMeDataTypeFeature;
            protocolData->ProtocolDataValue = NVME_FEATURE_HOST_CONTROLLED_THERMAL_MANAGEMENT;

            protocolData->ProtocolDataSubValue = 0; // This will pass to CDW11.
            protocolData->ProtocolDataSubValue2 = 0; // This will pass to CDW12.
            protocolData->ProtocolDataSubValue3 = 0; // This will pass to CDW13.
            protocolData->ProtocolDataSubValue4 = 0; // This will pass to CDW14.
            protocolData->ProtocolDataSubValue5 = 0; // This will pass to CDW15.

            protocolData->ProtocolDataOffset = 0;
            protocolData->ProtocolDataLength = 0;

            //
            // Send request down.
            //
            result = DeviceIoControl(m_deviceHandle,
                                     IOCTL_STORAGE_SET_PROPERTY,
                                     buffer,
                                     bufferLength,
                                     buffer,
                                     bufferLength,
                                     &returnedLength,
                                     NULL
            );
```

## Temperature queries

In Windows 10, [**IOCTL\_STORAGE\_QUERY\_PROPERTY**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_query_property) can also be used to query temperature data from NVMe devices.

To retrieve temperature information from an NVMe drive in the [**STORAGE\_TEMPERATURE\_DATA\_DESCRIPTOR**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoctl/ns-winioctl-storage_temperature_data_descriptor), configure the [**STORAGE\_PROPERTY\_QUERY**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ns-winioctl-storage_property_query) structure as follows:

-   Allocate a buffer that can contains a [**STORAGE\_PROPERTY\_QUERY**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoCtl/ns-winioctl-storage_property_query) structure.

-   Set the **PropertyID** field to **StorageAdapterTemperatureProperty** or **StorageDeviceTemperatureProperty** for a controller or device/namespace request, respectively.

-   Set the **QueryType** field to **PropertyStandardQuery**.

The [**STORAGE\_TEMPERATURE\_INFO**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoctl/ns-winioctl-storage_temperature_info) structure (from Windows 10) is shown here.


```C++
typedef struct _STORAGE_TEMPERATURE_INFO {

    USHORT  Index;                      // Starts from 0. Index 0 may indicate a composite value.
    SHORT   Temperature;                // Signed value; in Celsius.
    SHORT   OverThreshold;              // Signed value; in Celsius.
    SHORT   UnderThreshold;             // Signed value; in Celsius.

    BOOLEAN OverThresholdChangable;     // Can the threshold value being changed by using IOCTL_STORAGE_SET_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD.
    BOOLEAN UnderThresholdChangable;    // Can the threshold value being changed by using IOCTL_STORAGE_SET_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD.
    BOOLEAN EventGenerated;             // Indicates that notification will be generated when temperature cross threshold.
    UCHAR   Reserved0;
    ULONG   Reserved1;

} STORAGE_TEMPERATURE_INFO, *PSTORAGE_TEMPERATURE_INFO;
```



## Behavior changing commands

Commands that manipulate device attributes or potentially impact device behavior are more difficult for the operating system to deal with. If device attributes change at run-time while I/O is being processed, synchronization or data integrity issues can arise if not properly handled.

The NVMe **Set-Features** command is a good example of a behavior changing command. It allows for the changing of the arbitration mechanism and the setting of temperature thresholds. To ensure that in-flight data is not at risk when behavior-affecting set commands are sent down, Windows will pause all I/O to the NVMe device, drain queues, and flush buffers. Once the set command has executed successfully, I/O is resumed (if possible). If I/O cannot be resumed, a device reset may be required.

### Setting temperature thresholds

Windows 10 introduced [**IOCTL\_STORAGE\_SET\_TEMPERATURE\_THRESHOLD**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_set_temperature_threshold), an IOCTL for getting and setting temperature thresholds. You can also use it to get the current temperature of the device. The input/output buffer for this IOCTL is the [**STORAGE\_TEMPERATURE\_INFO**](/windows/desktop/api/WinIoctl/ns-winioctl-storage_temperature_info) structure, from the previous code section.

### Example: Setting over-threshold temperature

In this example, an NVMe drive's over-threshold temperature is set. The following code prepares the command and then sends it down to the device via DeviceIoControl.


```C++
    BOOL    result;  
    ULONG   returnedLength = 0;  
    
    STORAGE_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD setThreshold = {0};  

    setThreshold.Version = sizeof(STORAGE_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD); 
    setThreshold.Size = sizeof(STORAGE_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD);  
    setThreshold.Flags = STORAGE_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD_FLAG_ADAPTER_REQUEST;  
    setThreshold.Index = SensorIndex;  
    setThreshold.Threshold = Threshold;  
    setThreshold.OverThreshold = UpdateOverThreshold; 

    //  
    // Send request down.  
    //  

    result = DeviceIoControl(DeviceList[DeviceIndex].Handle,  
                             IOCTL_STORAGE_SET_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD,  
                             &setThreshold,  
                             sizeof(STORAGE_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD),  
                             NULL,  
                             0,  
                             &returnedLength,  
                             NULL  
                             ); 

```



### Setting vendor-specific features

Without the Command Effects Log, the driver has no knowledge of the ramifications of the command. This is why the Command Effects Log is required. It helps the operating system determine if a command is high impact and if it can be sent in parallel with other commands to the drive.

The Command Effects Log is not yet granular enough to encompass vendor-specific **Set-Features** commands. For this reason, it is not yet possible to send vendor-specific **Set-Features** commands. However, it is possible to use the pass-through mechanism, discussed earlier, to send vendor-specific commands. For more info, see [Pass-through mechanism](#pass-through-mechanism).
