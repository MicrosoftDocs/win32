# Testing for the End of a File

The [**ReadFile**](/windows/desktop/api/FileAPI/nf-fileapi-readfile) function checks for the end-of-file condition (EOF) differently for synchronous and asynchronous read operations. When a synchronous read operation gets to the end of a file, **ReadFile** returns **TRUE** and sets the variable pointed to by the *lpNumberOfBytesRead* parameter to zero. An asynchronous read operation can encounter the end of a file during the initiating call to **ReadFile** or during subsequent asynchronous operations if the file pointer is programmatically advanced beyond the end of the file.

The following C++ example shows how to test for the end of a file during a synchronous read operation.


```C++
  // Attempt a synchronous read operation.
  bResult = ReadFile(hFile, &inBuffer, nBytesToRead, &nBytesRead, NULL);

  // Check for eof.
  if (bResult &&  nBytesRead == 0) 
   {
    // at the end of the file
   }
```



The test for end-of-file during an asynchronous read operation is slightly more involved than for a similar synchronous read operation. The end-of-file indicator for asynchronous read operations is when [**GetOverlappedResult**](/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-getoverlappedresult) returns **FALSE** and [**GetLastError**](/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror) returns **ERROR\_HANDLE\_EOF**.

The following C++ example shows how to test for the end of file during an asynchronous read operation.


```C++
#include <windows.h>
#include <tchar.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define BUF_SIZE (61)

LPCTSTR ErrorMessage( DWORD error ) 

// Routine Description:
//      Retrieve the system error message for the last-error code
{ 

    LPVOID lpMsgBuf;

    FormatMessage(
        FORMAT_MESSAGE_ALLOCATE_BUFFER | 
        FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_SYSTEM |
        FORMAT_MESSAGE_IGNORE_INSERTS,
        NULL,
        error,
        MAKELANGID(LANG_NEUTRAL, SUBLANG_DEFAULT),
        (LPTSTR) &lpMsgBuf,
        0, NULL );

    return((LPCTSTR)lpMsgBuf);
}

void GoDoSomethingElse(void)

// Routine Description:
//     Placeholder to demo when async I/O might want to do
//     other processing.
{
    printf("Inside GoDoSomethingElse()\n");
}

DWORD AsyncTestForEnd( HANDLE hEvent, HANDLE hFile )

// Routine Description:
//      Demonstrate async ReadFile operations that can catch
//      End-of-file conditions. Unless the operation completes
//      synchronously or the file size happens to be an exact
//      multiple of BUF_SIZE, this routine will eventually force
//      an EOF condition on any file.

// Parameters:
//      hEvent - pre-made manual-reset event.
//
//      hFile - pre-opened file handle, overlapped.
//
//      inBuffer - the buffer to read in the data to.
//
//      nBytesToRead - how much to read (usually the buffer size).

// Return Value:
//      Number of bytes read.
{
    char inBuffer[BUF_SIZE];
    DWORD nBytesToRead      = BUF_SIZE;
    DWORD dwBytesRead       = 0;
    DWORD dwFileSize        = GetFileSize(hFile, NULL);
    OVERLAPPED stOverlapped = {0};

    DWORD dwError  = 0;
    LPCTSTR errMsg = NULL;

    BOOL bResult   = FALSE;
    BOOL bContinue = TRUE;

    // Set up overlapped structure event. Other members are already 
    // initialized to zero.
    stOverlapped.hEvent = hEvent; 

    // This is an intentionally brute-force loop to force the EOF trigger.
    // A properly designed loop for this simple file read would use the
    // GetFileSize API to regulate execution. However, the purpose here
    // is to demonstrate how to trigger the EOF error and handle it.

    while(bContinue)
    {
        // Default to ending the loop.
        bContinue = FALSE;
        
        // Attempt an asynchronous read operation.
        bResult = ReadFile(hFile,
                           inBuffer,
                           nBytesToRead,
                           &dwBytesRead,
                           &stOverlapped);

ReadFile operation is pending
