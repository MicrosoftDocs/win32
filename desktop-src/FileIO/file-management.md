# File Management (Local File Systems)

A *file object* provides a representation of a resource (either a physical device or a resource located on a physical device) that can be managed by the I/O system. Like other objects, they enable sharing of the resource, they have names, they are protected by object-based security, and they support synchronization. The I/O system also enables reading from or writing to the resource.
