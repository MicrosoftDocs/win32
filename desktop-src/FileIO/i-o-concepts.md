| [File Buffering](file-buffering.md)<br/>                                     | Describes considerations for application control of file buffering, also known as unbuffered file input/output (I/O).<br/>                                    |
| [File Caching](file-caching.md)<br/>                                         | Windows caches file data that is read from disks and written to disks.<br/>                                                                                   |
| [Synchronous and Asynchronous I/O](synchronous-and-asynchronous-i-o.md)<br/> | There are two types of input/output (I/O) synchronization: synchronous I/O and asynchronous I/O. Asynchronous I/O is also referred to as overlapped I/O.<br/> |
| [Canceling Pending I/O Operations](canceling-pending-i-o-operations.md)<br/> | Allowing users to cancel I/O requests that are slow or blocked can enhance the usability and robustness of your application.<br/>                             |
| [Alertable I/O](alertable-i-o.md)<br/>                                       | Alertable I/O is the method by which application threads process asynchronous I/O requests only when they are in an alertable state.<br/>                     |
| [I/O Completion Ports](i-o-completion-ports.md)<br/>                         | I/O completion ports provide an efficient threading model for processing multiple asynchronous I/O requests on a multiprocessor system.<br/>                  |
