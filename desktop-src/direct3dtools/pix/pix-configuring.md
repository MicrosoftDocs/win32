# Configure PIX

PIX has various options you can use to customize PIX to your liking. Most of these are accessed in the Settings menu (accessed via the main File menu).

## Debug symbols

When debugging shaders or profiling CPU code you'll want to provide PIX with debug symbols (PDBs) to enable function names and source code mappings. You can configure where PIX looks for these files in **Settings** under "Symbol / PDB Options".

For details on how to generate appropriate PDBs, see the blog post [Configuring PIX to access PDBs for CPU captures](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pix/configuring-pix-to-access-pdbs-for-cpu-captures/).
