# Games for Windows Test Cases: Best Practices for Games on Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8

This article provides test cases for games for Windows.

## How to Use This Article

There are three main sections to this article:

</dt> <dd>

Each test requirement in this document has four main sections: a title and a table with three notable sections (left column, right top, right bottom).

<dl> <dt>

<span id="Title"></span><span id="title"></span><span id="TITLE"></span>Title
</dt> <dd>

Name of the test case.

<span id="Box__far_left_column"></span><span id="box__far_left_column"></span><span id="BOX__FAR_LEFT_COLUMN"></span>Box, far left column
</dt> <dd>

Names of the operating systems to which the test case applies.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="Box__right_top"></span><span id="box__right_top"></span><span id="BOX__RIGHT_TOP"></span>Box, right top
</dt> <dd>

Brief summary of the test case.

</dd> <dt>

This section is a sample of the sequence that a typical test pass would follow if using the test requirements as a guide.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="Test_Tool_Notes"></span><span id="test_tool_notes"></span><span id="TEST_TOOL_NOTES"></span>**Test Tool Notes**

## Test Requirements

### 1. Game Requirements

### 1.1 Windows Games Explorer

<col  />
<col  />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Windows 7<br/> Windows Vista<br/></td>
<td>The game must be visible within the Games Explorer on Windows Vista and Windows 7. When selected, the game must also display correct metadata. The installation must not create a shortcut to launch the game on the desktop, in the Start menu, or in any other location. Tasks and shortcuts for removal must not be created.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

<td><ol>
<li>After installing the game, open Games Explorer.</li>
<li>Verify that the game icon displays in Games Explorer.</li>
<li>Right-click the icon and test each application-defined play & support task.</li>
<li>Click the icon and verify that the metadata (publisher, developer, genre, release date, version) at the bottom displays and is correct.</li>
<li>Verify that the game icon displays Windows Experience Index (WEI) information in Games Explorer.</li>
<li>Verify that game hyperlinks for metadata work correctly in Games Explorer. (If hyperlinks don't show up, then this is a possible sign that the exe isn't signed; see <a href="#23-sign-files">section 2.3</a>.)</li>
<li>Verify that the game displays accurate parental control rating in Games Explorer. (If it says unrated, then verify that this is an unrated game; otherwise, this is an indicator that the exe isn't signed; see <a href="#23-sign-files">section 2.3</a>.)</li>
<li>Verify that the game does not place launch shortcuts on user desktop.</li>
<li>Click Start -> All Programs.</li>
<li>Verify that the game does not place launch shortcuts in the Start Menu.</li>
<li>Verify that the game does not place uninstall shortcuts in Start Menu outside of Control Panel.</li>

### 6.1 Appverifier 4.0 (or higher)

**Test Case: 2.5, 4.2**

> [!Note]

14. Search the document (CTRL+F) for Severity="Error
15. Create bugs based on the LayerName= portion of the failure

### 6.2 Manifest Test - mt.exe

**Test Case: 1.8, 2.1**

This tool is run from a command prompt where MT.exe is located.

Example:

``` syntax
mt.exe -inputresource:"c:\yourdir\YourGame.exe";#1 -out:yourgame.manifest
```

1.  Click Start -> Run -> type cmd and click the OK button
2.  Run the mt.exe tool to generate a .manifest file for each .exe file that installs with the game
3.  Open the generated .manifest file
4.  Ensure that each .exe file contains the following (requested:

    ``` syntax
    <description>Example Game Name</description>
    <trustInfo xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v2">
      <security>
        <requestedPrivileges>
          <requestedExecutionLevel level="asInvoker"></requestedExecutionLevel>
        </requestedPrivileges>
      </security>
    </trustInfo>
      <asmv3:windowsSettings xmlns=http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2005/WindowsSettings>
        <dpiAware>true<dpiAware>
      </asmv3:windowsSettings>
    </asmv3:application>
    ```

> [!Note]  
> Requested execution level should be present for every file, and dpiAware should be present for at least the game s executable file.

 

### 6.3 Thread Hijacker - threadhijacker.exe

This tool is run from a command prompt where threadhijacker.exe is located.

Example:

``` syntax
threadhijacker.exe /process:str
```

Where str is the name\_of\_program.exe

1.  Bring up Task Manager, click the Processes tab, and locate the name of the game executable.
2.  Open a command prompt in Admin mode
3.  Navigate to the directory where threadhijacker.exe is
4.  Type: **threadhijacker.exe /process:**str, where str is the name of the executable that you want to hit

### 6.4 Microsoft Games for Windows Test Tool

This tool is located in the DirectX SDK. Once the SDK is installed on a computer, the installer for the Games for Windows Test Tool can be placed on the test computer and installed.

Locate the Microsoft Games for Windows Test Tool installer on the development computer where the DirectX SDK is installed. By default, it is placed in the following location:

``` syntax
%SystemDrive%\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK (Date)\Utilities\bin\x86\Microsoft Games for Windows Test Tools\
```

1.  Copy the installer (MicrosoftGFWTestTool.msi / setup.exe) to the test computer.
2.  Run the installer.
3.  Launch the Microsoft Games for Windows Test Tool.
4.  In the **Project List** field replace **Create New Project** with your title name and click **Create New**.

    Wait for the Baseline to complete.

5.  Fill in any information that you may have in the **Game Information** section, and click **Update Game Information**.
6.  Click on **Test Cases** tab.
7.  Starting at the top, proceed through the test cases, clicking **Pass** or **Fail** as appropriate.

    See "Writing a Bug", later in this section, for details on including a bug in the report.

8.  Return to the **Projects** tab after reviewing the report (by checking the **Report** and **Bug Edit** tabs).
9.  Click **Compile Report**.

    A window will open when the report is finished compiling. Here you will find a .ZIP file names *ProjectName*\_report.zip. This file contains all of the logs and results collected during the test pass.

### Writing a Bug

There are two ways to write a bug report: you can go through the test cases and click **Fail** when the title fails a test case, or you can click the **Bug Edit** tab and manually add a bug report.

### Clicking Fail on a test case

1.  When you click **Fail** on a test case, the **Issue Type** drop-down list will automatically be set to the test case type.
2.  Add a short description to the **Title** field that briefly describes the issue.
3.  Add a detailed description of the issue to the **Observed Behavior** field.
4.  As appropriate, add what was expected (as opposed to a description of the issue) to the **Expected Behavior** field.
5.  Add a detailed description of how to reproduce the issue to the **Repro-Steps** field.
6.  When done, click the **Save** button.

### Manually Adding a Bug

This process is the same as clicking **Fail**, with the exception of the auto-populated drop-down list. In this case, either select the appropriate TCR failure type or select **\*\* Non-TR Issue \*\*** for bugs that fall outside of the TR range but should still be reported.
