# Mobile Computing Configurations for SENS

Connectivity functions and notifications are useful for computers configured as follows:

-   A mobile computer used in a docking station on a high bandwidth network which may occasionally use a dial-in connection.
-   A mobile computer using a dial-in connection exclusively.
-   A desktop computer using a dial-in connection exclusively.
-   A desktop computer connected to a high bandwidth network with latency issues.

In each of these configurations, the connection bandwidth and latency information can be used by an application to dynamically optimize its operations for network availability.
