# About System Event Notification Service

Applications designed for use by mobile users require a unique set of connectivity functions and notifications, and in the past individual applications were required to implement these features internally. The System Event Notification Service (SENS) now provides these capabilities in the operating system, creating a uniform connectivity and notification interface for applications. SENS, the Synchronization Manager, and Client Side Caching combine to provide the infrastructure to fully support mobile computing.

The topics in this section offer an overview about SENS:

-   [Mobile Computing Configurations for SENS](mobile-computing-configurations-for-sens.md)

    Lists several mobile computer configurations that can benefit from the use of SENS-enabled applications.

-   [Application Scenarios for SENS](application-scenarios-for-sens.md)

    Lists several types of applications that can benefit by utilizing SENS functionality.

-   [Notifications](notifications.md)

    Lists the system events that SENS monitors and dispatches.

-   [SENS Architecture](sens-architecture.md)

    A description of the internal architecture of SENS.
