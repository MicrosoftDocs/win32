# Determining the Status of a Job

The status of a job refers to changes in the state of a job (for example, the job changes state from BG\_JOB\_STATE\_TRANSFERRING to BG\_JOB\_STATE\_TRANSFERRED) and progress in transferring the files. To capture changes in the status of a job, use the following options:

-   [Poll for the status of the job](polling-for-the-status-of-the-job.md).
-   [Register to receive event notification](registering-a-com-callback.md).
-   [Register to execute a program](registering-to-execute-a-program.md) based on an event.

To get information about the progress of a job, see [Determining the Progress of a Job](determining-the-progress-of-a-job.md).
