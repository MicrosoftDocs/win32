| [BITS C++ Application Examples](bits-c---application-examples.md) | C++ examples that demonstrate a range of tasks that can be completed by using BITS features. |



 

In addition, BITS includes the following samples in Windows SDK. The samples are located under *InstallDirectory*\\Samples\\Web. Each sample includes a Readme.txt file that explains how to install and run the sample. You can download the Windows SDK from [Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsserver/bb980924.aspx). BITS is included in the Core SDK.

> [!Note]  
> Windows Vista: The samples on this page are included in the [Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows Vista](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30998). However, the ClientCert sample is not included.
