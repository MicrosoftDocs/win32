# BITS C++ Application Examples

The Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) application examples in this section are written in C++. They demonstrate a range of tasks that can be completed by using BITS features. Each application is separated into a series of steps.

The following table lists the C++ examples in this section.



| Example                                                                                                                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Example: Common Classes](common-classes.md)                                                                                                                      | This example contains common classes that are used for the examples in this section. These common classes include a callback class, a generic error class, and a resource acquisition helper class for the COM [CoInitializeEx](/windows/win32/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializeex) function. |
| [Example: Specifying Server Authentication Credentials for a BITS Transfer Job](example-specifying-server-authentication-credentials-for-a-bits-transfer-job-.md) | This example gets the authorization scheme and credentials from the user, creates a BITS transfer job, sets the credentials for the job, and monitors the status of the job.                                                                                                               |
| [Example: Using SSPI Authentication Encoding with BITS.](example-using-sspi-authentication-encoding-with-bits.md)                                                 | This example demonstrates the use of Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) authentication and BITS to get the credentials from a user, encode the credentials, and set the encoded credentials on a BITS transfer job.                                                                |
| [Example: Adding a Helper Token to a BITS Transfer Job](example-adding-a-helper-token-to-a-bits-transfer-job-.md)                                                 | This example creates a BITS transfer job and adds a second set of credentials to the job.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
