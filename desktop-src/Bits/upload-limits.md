# Upload Limits

To limit the size of uploads, set the [**BITSMaximumUploadSize**](bits-iis-extension-properties.md) IIS extension property. In IIS 7, you may also have to modify the **maxAllowedContentLength** attribute. By default, the IIS 7 upload limit is 30 million bytes. For details and information on changing the IIS default, see [KB942074](https://support.microsoft.com//kb/942074).
