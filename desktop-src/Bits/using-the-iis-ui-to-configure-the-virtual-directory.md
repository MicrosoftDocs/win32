# Using the IIS UI to Configure the Virtual Directory

To use the IIS user interface to configure the virtual directory for BITS uploads, select **Properties** from the context menu of the virtual directory. Press the **BITS Extension** tab to access the BITS properties page (the BITS server extension ISAPI must be installed). Change the default property values as appropriate and enable the directory for uploads; you cannot upload files until the directory is enabled. For details on setting the property values, see the online Help.
