# System Monitor

## Purpose

System Monitor (SYSMON) is the application programming interface (API) that you use to configure the Microsoft System Monitor ActiveX control. The System Monitor control lets you view real-time and previously logged performance counter data such as memory, disk, and processor counter data.

## Where applicable

Use the SYSMON API when you add the System Monitor control to any ActiveX-enabled container such as a Microsoft Word document, or a web page viewed by Internet Explorer, and you want to modify its default behavior. For example, you can create a performance monitor that will only display a predefined set of system counters, or with predefined display settings.

## Developer audience

SYSMON is designed for use by C, C++, Visual Basic, and scripting developers.

## Run-time requirements

SYSMON is available starting with Microsoft Windows 2000.

For information about run-time requirements for a particular programming element, see the Requirements section of the reference page for that element.
