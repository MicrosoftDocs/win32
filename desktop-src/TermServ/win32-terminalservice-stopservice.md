# StopService method of the Win32_Service class (Sdoias.h) for the Terminal service

The **StopService** [WMI class](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/retrieving-a-class) method places the service, represented by the [**Win32\_TerminalService**](win32-terminalservice.md) object, in the stopped state.

This topic uses Managed Object Format (MOF) syntax. For more information about using this method, see [Calling a Method](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/calling-a-method).

## Syntax


```mof
uint32 StopService();
```



## Parameters

This method has no parameters.

## Return value

Returns one of the values listed in the following list, or any other value to indicate an error. For additional error codes, see [**WMI Error Constants**](/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/wmi-error-constants) or [**WbemErrorEnum**](/windows/desktop/api/wbemdisp/ne-wbemdisp-wbemerrorenum). For general **HRESULT** values, see [System Error Codes](/windows/desktop/Debug/system-error-codes).

## Remarks

After you have determined which services can be stopped or paused, you can use the **StopService** and [**PauseService**](win32-terminalservice-pauseservice.md) methods to stop and pause services. The decision to stop a service rather than pause it, or vice versa, depends on several factors, including the following:

-   Is the service capable of being paused? If not, your only option is the stop the service.
-   Do you need to continue handling client requests for anyone already connected to the service? If so, pausing a service typically allows it to handle existing clients while denying access to new clients. By contrast, when you stop a service, all clients are immediately disconnected.
-   Do you need to reconfigure a service and have the changes take effect immediately? Although service properties can be changed while a service is paused, most of them do not take effect until the service is actually stopped and restarted.

The scripting code required to stop a service is almost identical to the code required to pause the service.

If you attempt to stop a service which has dependent services running, the **StopService** method fails with a return value of 3. The dependent services must be stopped first.

If you stop a service, then immediately check the [**Win32\_TerminalService**](win32-terminalservice.md).**State** property, as the value may still show the service as running.
