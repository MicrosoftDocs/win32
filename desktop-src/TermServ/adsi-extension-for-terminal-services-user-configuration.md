# ADSI extension for Remote Desktop Services user configuration

An Active Directory Service Interface (ADSI) extension is a special COM object that allows extension of a COM object. ADSI extensions can add functionality to a directory object and simplify administration tasks.

The ADSI extension for Remote Desktop Services user configuration extends an ADSI object that allows domain administrators to write scripts that will automate maintenance of Remote Desktop Services-specific user properties.

The ADSI extension for Remote Desktop Services user configuration is included in Windows Server.
