# Remote Desktop Connection Broker client API

The Remote Desktop Connection Broker is a component of Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) deployment, which, for a remote connection, will find a suitable target from a pool of computers where the connection can be redirected and returns the IP address of the target. The Connection Broker client API allows third party protocol vendors to leverage the Connection Broker to expedite the handling of connections using their protocol to virtual machines or Remote Desktop servers in a farm.
