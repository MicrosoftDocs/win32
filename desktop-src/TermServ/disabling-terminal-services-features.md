# Disabling Remote Desktop Services features

For enhanced security, you might choose to disable Remote Desktop Services features such as clipboard redirection and printer redirection for clients that connect to Remote Desktop Session Host (RD Session Host) servers using the Remote Desktop ActiveX Control.

**To disable Remote Desktop Services features**

1.  Edit the registry of the client computer and add the following keys:

    -   **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server\\DisableClipboardRedirection**
    -   **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server\\DisableDriveRedirection**
    -   **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server\\DisablePrinterRedirection**

2.  Set the value of both keys to **REG\_DWORD** 1.
