# Using the Remote Desktop Services API

This section describes how you can use the Remote Desktop Services API to enable applications to perform the following tasks in a Remote Desktop Services environment:

-   Performing [Remote Desktop Services Administration](terminal-services-administration.md) tasks, such as enumerating and managing Remote Desktop Session Host (RD Session Host) servers in a domain or enumerating and managing sessions and processes on an RD Session Host server.
-   Enhancing client/server applications in a Remote Desktop Services environment.
-   [Using Remote Desktop Services Virtual Channels](using-terminal-services-virtual-channels.md) to communicate between client and server modules of an application.
-   Setting and retrieving [Remote Desktop Services User Configuration](terminal-services-user-configuration.md) information.

If your application runs in an environment that is not a Remote Desktop Services environment, but you want to use the Remote Desktop Services API to provide additional functionality in a Remote Desktop Services environment, see [Run-Time Linking to Wtsapi32.dll](run-time-linking-to-wtsapi32-dll.md).
