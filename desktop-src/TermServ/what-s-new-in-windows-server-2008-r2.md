<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Terminal Services Is Now Remote Desktop Services<br/></td>
<td>Terminal Services has been renamed Remote Desktop Services. A server that has the Remote Desktop Session Host (RD Session Host) role service installed is now called an RD Session Host server, instead of a terminal server.<br/>

<tr class="even">
<td>Remote Desktop Virtualization API<br/></td>
<td>The Remote Desktop Virtualization API provides enumerations, interfaces, and structures that you can use to create custom plug-ins that override the standard redirection logic of Remote Desktop Connection Broker (RD Connection Broker). RD Connection Broker (formerly known as TS Session Broker) was expanded to support connections to virtual machines.<br/>
