# Remote Desktop Virtualization API reference

The Remote Desktop Virtualization API supports interfaces and structures that you can use to create custom plug-ins that override the standard redirection logic of Remote Desktop Connection Broker (RD Connection Broker). The custom plug-ins can redirect connections to Remote Desktop Session Host (RD Session Host) servers, as well as virtual machines, virtual desktops, blade servers, and physical desktops.
