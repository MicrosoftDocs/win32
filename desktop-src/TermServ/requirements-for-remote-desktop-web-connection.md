# Requirements for Remote Desktop Web Connection

Remote Desktop Web Connection requires two systems configured as follows:

-   A host server running Windows and IIS 4.0 or later.
-   A client that can download and run the Remote Desktop ActiveX control. Any client running Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 (preferably Service Pack 2) or later can run the Remote Desktop ActiveX control.

The user installing the software must have sufficient privileges to install software. For example, on Windows XP the user must be a member of the Power Users or Administrators groups.
