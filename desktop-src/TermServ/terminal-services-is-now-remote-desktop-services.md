# Terminal Services has been renamed

**Terminal Services** has been renamed to **Remote Desktop Services**.

In Windows Server 2008 R2, all **Remote Desktop Services** role services have been renamed. The following table lists both the former name and the new name of each **Remote Desktop Services** role service.



| Previous name                                                   | Name in Windows Server 2008 R2                                         |

| Terminal Services <br/>                                   | Remote Desktop Services<br/>                                     |
| Terminal Server<br/>                                      | Remote Desktop Session Host (RD Session Host)<br/>               |
| Terminal Services Licensing (TS  Licensing)<br/>          | Remote Desktop Licensing (RD Licensing)<br/>                     |
| Terminal Services Gateway (TS Gateway)<br/>               | Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway)<br/>                         |
| Terminal Services Session Broker (TS Session Broker)<br/> | Remote Desktop Connection Broker (RD Connection Broker)<br/>     |
| Terminal Services Web Access (TS Web Access)<br/>         | Remote Desktop Web Access (RD  Web Access)<br/>                  |
| Terminal Services Virtualization<br/>                     | Remote Desktop Virtualization Host (RD Virtualization Host)<br/> |



 

Also, please note that a server that has the RD Session Host role service installed is now called a RD Session Host server, instead of a terminal server.
