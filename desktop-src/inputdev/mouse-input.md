[**SetCapture**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setcapture) captures mouse input either when the mouse is over the capturing window, or when the mouse button was pressed while the mouse was over the capturing window and the button is still down. Only one window at a time can capture the mouse.<br/> If the mouse cursor is over a window created by another thread, the system will direct mouse input to the specified window only if a mouse button is down.<br/> |
| [**SetDoubleClickTime**](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setdoubleclicktime)          | Sets the double-click time for the mouse.
