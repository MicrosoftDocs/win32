# WM\_SYSDEADCHAR message

Sent to the window with the keyboard focus when a [**WM\_SYSKEYDOWN**](wm-syskeydown.md) message is translated by the [**TranslateMessage**](/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-translatemessage) function. **WM\_SYSDEADCHAR** specifies the character code of a system dead key   that is, a dead key that is pressed while holding down the ALT key.


```C++
#define WM_SYSDEADCHAR                  0x0107
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*wParam* 
</dt> <dd>

The character code generated by the system dead key   that is, a dead key that is pressed while holding down the ALT key.

</dd> <dt>

*lParam* 
</dt> <dd>

The repeat count, scan code, extended-key flag, context code, previous key-state flag, and transition-state flag, as shown in the following table.



| Bits  | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0-15  | The repeat count for the current message. The value is the number of times the keystroke is autorepeated as a result of the user holding down the key. If the keystroke is held long enough, multiple messages are sent. However, the repeat count is not cumulative. |
| 16-23 | The scan code. The value depends on the OEM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 24    | Indicates whether the key is an extended key, such as the right-hand ALT and CTRL keys that appear on an enhanced 101- or 102-key keyboard. The value is 1 if it is an extended key; otherwise, it is 0.                                                              |
| 25-28 | Reserved; do not use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 29    | The context code. The value is 1 if the ALT key is held down while the key is pressed; otherwise, the value is 0.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 30    | The previous key state. The value is 1 if the key is down before the message is sent, or it is 0 if the key is up.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 31    | Transition state. The value is 1 if the key is being released, or it is 0 if the key is being pressed.                                                                                                                                                                |

</dd> </dl>

## Return value

An application should return zero if it processes this message.

## Remarks

For enhanced 101- and 102-key keyboards, extended keys are the right ALT and CTRL keys on the main section of the keyboard; the INS, DEL, HOME, END, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, and arrow keys in the clusters to the left of the numeric keypad; and the divide (/) and ENTER keys in the numeric keypad. Other keyboards may support the extended-key bit in the *lParam* parameter.
