# Mobile Device Management (MDM) registration

## Purpose

An industry trend has been developing in which employees connect their personal mobile computing devices to the corporate network and resources (either on premise or through the cloud) to perform workplace tasks. This trend requires support for easy configuration of the network and resources, such that employees can register personal devices with the company for work-related purposes. Applications and technology to support easy configuration must also enable IT professionals to manage the risk associated with having uncontrolled devices connected to the corporate network. The Mobile Device Management (MDM) registration enrolls a device into a management service.
