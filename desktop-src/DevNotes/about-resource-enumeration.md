# About Resource Enumeration

Resource enumeration provides a close and precise view of instrumentation activity that takes place when an application is running. The instrumentation information can be abstracted and categorized as a set of process-specific items as part of the debugging process.

Tools, such as debuggers, often require access to instrumentation information but may find it is unavailable. To solve this problem, the [**VerifierEnumerateResource**](/windows/desktop/api/Avrfsdk/nf-avrfsdk-verifierenumerateresource) function extracts this type of information from applications to provide better context information for the problem being debugged.
