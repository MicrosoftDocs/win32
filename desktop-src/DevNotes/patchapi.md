# PatchAPI

This section documents several functions that belong to the PatchAPI interface. PatchAPI is part of the [Delta Compression API](/previous-versions/bb417345(v=msdn.10)), which is designed to programmatically create deltas (similar to patches or compressed diffs) between files.

## In this section

- [CreatePatchFileEx](patchapi-createpatchfileex.md)
- [ExtractPatchHeaderToFile](patchapi-extractpatchheadertofile.md)
