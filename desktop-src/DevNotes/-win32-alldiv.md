# \_alldiv Routine

Divides two **LONGLONG** integers. For example, to divide two int64 values the compiler might generate a call to \_alldiv Routine.

## Remarks

\_alldiv Routine is a helper routine for the C compiler. Whether the compiler calls \_alldiv Routine is completely dependent on the optimization set.
