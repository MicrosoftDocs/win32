# Elements of the SDO API

The SDO API is designed around an object model consisting of objects and collections of objects. In the SDO object model, the objects and collections are arranged in a hierarchy, that is, objects and collections contain other objects and collections.

Objects are manipulated by retrieving and setting object properties.

The following sections describe how the SDO API uses objects, object properties, and collections:

-   [Objects and Properties](/windows/desktop/Nps/sdo-objects-and-properties)
-   [Object Model Hierarchy](/windows/desktop/Nps/sdo-object-model-hierarchy)
-   [Attributes](/windows/desktop/Nps/sdo-sdo-supported-attributes)
