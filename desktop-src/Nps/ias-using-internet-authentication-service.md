# Using NPS Extensions

Internet Authentication Service (IAS) was renamed Network Policy Server (NPS). The content of this topic applies to both IAS and NPS. Throughout the text, NPS is used to refer to all versions of the service, including the versions originally referred to as IAS.

**Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2008:**

The DialIn and MapName samples extend NPS functionality.

| Sample | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| DialIn | This sample implements a RADIUS extension DLL that checks the dial-in bit for the user. |
| MapName | This sample extension DLL searches all trusted domains for the designated account. This allows users from multiple domains to be authenticated without the users having to supply their domain name. |

You can find the source code for the MapName and DialIn sample applications in the following list. *Location*, `%Install Path%`, designates the base installation directory for x64 computers.
