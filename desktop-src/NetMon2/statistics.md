# STATISTICS structure

The **STATISTICS** structure provides statistics for the capture. Some of these statistics are generated by Network Monitor, while others are generated by the NIC that the NPP is connected to.

## Syntax


```C++
typedef struct _STATISTICS {
  __int64 TimeElapsed;
  DWORD   TotalFramesCaptured;
  DWORD   TotalBytesCaptured;
  DWORD   TotalFramesFiltered;
  DWORD   TotalBytesFiltered;
  DWORD   TotalMulticastsFiltered;
  DWORD   TotalBroadcastsFiltered;
  DWORD   TotalFramesSeen;
  DWORD   TotalBytesSeen;
  DWORD   TotalMulticastsReceived;
  DWORD   TotalBroadcastsReceived;
  DWORD   TotalFramesDropped;
  DWORD   TotalFramesDroppedFromBuffer;
  DWORD   MacFramesReceived;
  DWORD   MacCRCErrors;
  __int64 MacBytesReceivedEx;
  DWORD   MacFramesDropped_NoBuffers;
  DWORD   MacMulticastsReceived;
  DWORD   MacBroadcastsReceived;
  DWORD   MacFramesDropped_HwError;
} STATISTICS, *LPSTATISTICS;
```



## Members

<dl> <dt>

**TimeElapsed**
</dt> <dd>

Elapsed time, in microseconds.

</dd> <dt>

**TotalFramesCaptured**
</dt> <dd>

Total number of frames currently stored. This number is limited by the size of the capture file or buffer used to store the frames.

</dd> <dt>

**TotalBytesCaptured**
</dt> <dd>

Total number of bytes currently stored. This number is limited by the size of the capture file or buffer used to store the frames.

</dd> <dt>

**TotalFramesFiltered**
</dt> <dd>

Total number of frames that passed through the current capture filter. If a filter is not used, this value is the same as **TotalFramesSeen**.

</dd> <dt>

**TotalBytesFiltered**
</dt> <dd>

Total number of frames that passed through the current capture filter. If a filter is not used, this value is the same as **TotalBytesSeen**.

</dd> <dt>

**TotalMulticastsFiltered**
</dt> <dd>

This member is obsolete.

</dd> <dt>

**TotalBroadcastsFiltered**
</dt> <dd>

This member is obsolete.

</dd> <dt>

**TotalFramesSeen**
</dt> <dd>

Total number of frames handled by the NIC.

</dd> <dt>

**TotalBytesSeen**
</dt> <dd>

Total number of bytes handled by the NIC.

</dd> <dt>

**TotalMulticastsReceived**
</dt> <dd>

This member is obsolete.

</dd> <dt>

**TotalBroadcastsReceived**
</dt> <dd>

This member is obsolete.

</dd> <dt>

**TotalFramesDropped**
</dt> <dd>

Total number of frames dropped (frames that passed the filter but were not saved).

</dd> <dt>

**TotalFramesDroppedFromBuffer**
</dt> <dd>

Number of frames dropped from the capture file or buffer. When the buffer is full, older frames are removed to make room for new ones.

</dd> <dt>

**MacFramesReceived**
</dt> <dd>

Number of frames that the NIC reports having received.

</dd> <dt>

**MacCRCErrors**
</dt> <dd>

Number of CRC errors reported by the NIC.

</dd> <dt>

**MacBytesReceivedEx**
</dt> <dd>

Number of bytes that the NIC reports having received.

</dd> <dt>

**MacFramesDropped\_NoBuffers**
</dt> <dd>

Number of frames that the NIC reports having dropped due to a lack of buffer space.

</dd> <dt>

**MacMulticastsReceived**
</dt> <dd>

Number of multicasts the NIC reports having received.

</dd> <dt>

**MacBroadcastsReceived**
</dt> <dd>

Number of broadcasts the NIC reports having received.

</dd> <dt>

**MacFramesDropped\_HwError**
</dt> <dd>

Number of frames the NIC reports as having dropped due to hardware errors.

</dd> </dl>

## Remarks

This structure is used to retrieve [*total statistics*](t.md), and to pause or stop the current capture.

Total statistics cannot be retrieved when using the [IESP](iesp.md) NPP interface.
