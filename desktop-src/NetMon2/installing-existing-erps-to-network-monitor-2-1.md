# Installing Existing ERPs to Network Monitor 2.1

After you write and name an event reference page (ERP), you must install it.

**To install an event reference page**

1.  Create an ERP directory. These examples demonstrate directories for experts:

    ``` syntax
    C:\Program Files\NetMon2\Bok\Expert\
    ```

2.  Create a subdirectory for each new expert that will display the ERPs. The following subdirectory listings are for an expert:

    ``` syntax
    C:\Program Files\NetMon2\Bok\Experts\MyExpert
    ```

3.  Copy the ERP files to the associated subdirectory. The following examples provide complete paths to installed expert ERPs:

    ``` syntax
    C:\Program Files\NetMon2\Bok\Experts\MyExpert\MyExpert1.htm
    ```
