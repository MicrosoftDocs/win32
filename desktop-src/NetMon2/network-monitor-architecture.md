# Network Monitor Architecture

The Network Monitor architecture can be separated into two sets of programming concepts, those related to [*expert*](e.md) and [*parser*](p.md) development and those related to [*monitor*](m.md) development.

Although both use the same components to capture the network traffic, they each use different interfaces to capture the data and different components to analyze what was captured.
