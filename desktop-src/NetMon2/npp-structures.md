# NPP Structures

This section describes the NPP structures used by NPP methods. These structures are used to retrieve statistics, provide system status and statistical information, and indicate which computers are running Network Monitor. The following tables describes these structures.



| NPP Structures                     | Description                                                                                                                      |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [SESSIONSTATS](sessionstats.md)   | Provides session information when conversation statistics are retrieved.                                                         |
| [STATIONSTATS](stationstats.md)   | Provides statistics about a specific [*station*](s.md).                                                     |
| [STATISTICS](statistics.md)       | Provides network statistics when total statistics are retrieved and when the current capture has paused or stopped.              |
| [QUERYTABLE](querytable.md)       | Indicates which computers are using Network Monitor.                                                                             |
| [STATIONQUERY](stationquery.md)   | Provides information about a computer that is using Network Monitor. This structure is used by the NPP **QUERYTABLE** structure. |
| [NETWORKSTATUS](networkstatus.md) | Provides current network status in terms of system state.                                                                        |
