# F (Network Monitor)

<dl> <dt>

<span id="_netmon_filter_blob_gly"></span><span id="_NETMON_FILTER_BLOB_GLY"></span>**filter BLOB**
</dt> <dd>

Binary large object (BLOB) used to restrict the search for a network interface card (NIC). Each entry in the filter BLOB must match an equivalent entry in the network packet provider (NPP) BLOB that represents the NIC. For example, an application can request only Ethernet cards, or cards that support a specific frame rate. You can use a filter BLOB to call the **GetNPPBlobFromUI** and **GetNPPBlobTable** functions.

<span id="_netmon_follow_set_gly"></span><span id="_NETMON_FOLLOW_SET_GLY"></span>**follow set**
</dt> <dd>

A protocol set that follows a protocol. Network Monitor uses the follow set of a protocol if the parser cannot detect the next protocol from the data in the capture. See also [*handoff set*](h.md)

<span id="_netmon_frame_gly"></span><span id="_NETMON_FRAME_GLY"></span>**frame**
</dt> <dd>

A packet of data that is transmitted as one unit over a network. Each frame follows the same basic organization, and contains control information such as synchronizing characters, station addresses, an error-checking value, and a variable amount of data. Also called a packet.

<span id="_netmon_frame_viewer_window_gly"></span><span id="_NETMON_FRAME_VIEWER_WINDOW_GLY"></span>**frame viewer window**
