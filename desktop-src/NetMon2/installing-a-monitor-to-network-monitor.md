# Installing a Monitor to Network Monitor

Installing a monitor DLL is a simple process. First, copy the DLL and the associated HTML configuration form to your NPP Monitors subdirectory (for example, C:\\Windows\\System32\\Npp\\Monitors). When copied to the directory, the monitor will be recognized and available the next time the Monitor Control Tool or Monitor Control Service (MCSVC) is activated.

For example, if the environment variable, %SystemRoot% is C:\\Windows, then the monitor subdirectory is C:\\Windows\\System32\\Npp\\Monitors.
