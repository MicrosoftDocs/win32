# Capture Filters

The Network Monitor SDK includes capture filters, with which you can restrict the number of frames a network packet provider (NPP) application receives during its operation. By specifying which frames of network traffic you want a custom monitor or NPP application to examine, you can improve its processing efficiency.

This section includes these topics:

-   [About Capture Filters](about-capture-filters.md)
-   [**The CAPTUREFILTER Structure**](the-capturefilter-structure.md)
