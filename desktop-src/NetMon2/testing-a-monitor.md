# Testing a Monitor

After a monitor is installed, you can test it with live data from your network operations, or you can test a known set of events by capturing the data with Network Monitor, saving the capture file, and then transmitting the data locally. (For details about how to transmit a capture file on a network, see Network Monitor online Help.)
