# Selecting a NIC from a Supplied NPP BLOB table

To select a network interface card (NIC) from a supplied NPP BLOB table, call the [**SelectNPPBlobFromTable**](selectnppblobfromtable.md) function. This function uses the Network Monitor UI to display the NICs represented in the BLOB table and returns the NPP BLOB that represents the selected NIC.

When you call the [**SelectNPPBlobFromTable**](selectnppblobfromtable.md) function, the **Select a network** dialog box appears. From it, you can view the details of the NPPs represented in the NPP BLOB table, select a specific NIC, and view the details of its associated NPP BLOB structure.

The following illustration shows the NICs represented in a supplied NPP BLOB table.
