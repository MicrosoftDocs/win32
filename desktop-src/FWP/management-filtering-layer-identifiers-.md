# Filtering Layer Identifiers

The Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) layer identifiers are each represented by a GUID. These identifiers are defined as follows.

The V4 and V6 suffixes at the end of the layer identifiers indicate whether the layer is located in the IPv4 network stack or in the IPv6 network stack.

<dl> <dt>

<span id="FWPM_LAYER_INBOUND_IPPACKET_V4___FWPM_LAYER_INBOUND_IPPACKET_V6"></span><span id="fwpm_layer_inbound_ippacket_v4___fwpm_layer_inbound_ippacket_v6"></span>**FWPM\_LAYER\_INBOUND\_IPPACKET\_V4 / FWPM\_LAYER\_INBOUND\_IPPACKET\_V6**

If IPv4 is uninstalled in the host, filters in this layer will cause packets to be dropped.

## Remarks

These filtering layer identifiers are also referred to as management filtering layer identifiers. WFP API also contains a set of [run-time filtering layer identifiers](/windows-hardware/drivers/network/management-filtering-layer-identifiers), documented in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK). Run-time filtering layer identifiers are LUIDs, and therefore are smaller, only 64 bits in size, compared to the management filtering layer identifiers, which are 128 bits in size.

Management filtering layer identifiers and run-time filtering layer identifiers point to the same layers.

Management filtering layer identifiers are used by functions that interact with the Base Filtering Engine (BFE) from either user mode or kernel mode (for example, [**FwpmFilterAdd0**](/windows/desktop/api/Fwpmu/nf-fwpmu-fwpmfilteradd0)).

Run-time filtering layer identifiers are used by functions that interact with the filter engine from kernel mode only (for example, [FwpsFlowAssociateContext0](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/fwpsk/nf-fwpsk-fwpsflowassociatecontext0), [FwpsStreamInjectAsync0](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/fwpsk/nf-fwpsk-fwpsstreaminjectasync0)), and in data structures that come directly from the kernel (for example, [**FWPM\_NET\_EVENT\_CLASSIFY\_DROP0**](/windows/desktop/api/Fwpmtypes/ns-fwpmtypes-fwpm_net_event_classify_drop0)).
