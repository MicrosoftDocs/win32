# RestoreProperties method of the CIM\_LogicalDevice class

Requests that the Device re-establish its configuration, setup and/or state information from a backing store. The intent is to capture this information at an earlier time (via the SaveProperties method), and use it to return a Device to this earlier "condition". This method may not be supported by all Devices. The method should return 0 if successful, 1 if the request is not supported, and some other value if any other error occurred. In a subclass, the set of possible return codes could be specified, using a ValueMap qualifier on the method. The strings to which the ValueMap contents are \\'translated\\' may also be specified in the subclass as a Values array qualifier.

## Syntax


```mof
uint32 RestoreProperties();
```



## Parameters

## Return value
