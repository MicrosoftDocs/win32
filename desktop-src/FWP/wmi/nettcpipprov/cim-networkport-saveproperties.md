# SaveProperties method of the CIM\_NetworkPort class

Requests that the Device capture its current configuration, setup and/or state information in a backing store. The goal would be to use this information at a later time (via the RestoreProperties method), to return a Device to its present "condition". This method may not be supported by all Devices. The method should return 0 if successful, 1 if the request is not supported, and some other value if any other error occurred. In a subclass, the set of possible return codes could be specified, using a ValueMap qualifier on the method. The strings to which the ValueMap contents are \\'translated\\' may also be specified in the subclass as a Values array qualifier.

## Syntax


```mof
uint32 SaveProperties();
```



## Parameters

This method has no parameters.

## Return value

TBD
