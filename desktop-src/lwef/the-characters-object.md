# The Characters Object

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

Your client application can support one or more characters. In addition, you can share a character among several applications. Microsoft Agent defines the [**Characters**](/windows/desktop/lwef/the-characters-object) object as a collection of characters. To access a character, load the character's data into the [**Characters**](/windows/desktop/lwef/the-characters-object) collection and specify that the item in the collection uses the methods and properties supported for that character.
