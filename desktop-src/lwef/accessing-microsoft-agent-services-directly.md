# Accessing Microsoft Agent Services Directly

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

If you are using C, C++, or Java, you can access the Microsoft Agent server directly using its ActiveX (OLE) interfaces. For more information on these interfaces, see [Programming the Microsoft Agent Server Interface](programming-the-microsoft-agent-server-interface.md).
