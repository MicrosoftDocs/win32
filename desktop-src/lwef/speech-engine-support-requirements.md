# Speech Engine Support Requirements

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

Microsoft Agent uses the Microsoft Speech Application Programming Interface (SAPI) to support speech input (speech recognition, or SR) and speech output (text-to-speech, or TTS). By supporting this standard, Microsoft Agent's speech services can be supported by other speech engines. This document describes the required SAPI interfaces used by Microsoft Agent. For more information about SAPI, see the [Microsoft Speech](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee705648.aspx) group's web site.
