# IAgentCommandsEx::GetHelpContextID

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

``` syntax
HRESULT GetHelpContextID(
   long * pulHelpID  // address of Commands object help topic ID
);
```

Retrieves the [**HelpContextID**](helpcontextid-property.md) for a [**Command**](/windows/desktop/lwef/the-command-object) object.

-   Returns S\_OK to indicate the operation was successful.

<dl> <dt>

<span id="pulHelpID"></span><span id="pulhelpid"></span><span id="PULHELPID"></span>*pulHelpID*
</dt> <dd>

Address of a variable that receives the context number of the help topic for the [**Command**](/windows/desktop/lwef/the-command-object) object.

</dd> </dl>

If you've created a Windows Help file for your application and set the character's [**HelpFile**](helpfile-property.md) property, Microsoft Agent automatically calls Help when [**HelpModeOn**](helpmodeon-property.md) is set to **True** and the user selects your [**Command**](/windows/desktop/lwef/the-command-object) object. If there is a context number in the [**HelpContextID**](helpcontextid-property.md), Agent calls Help and searches for the topic identified by the current context number. The current context number is the value of **HelpContextID** for the **Command** object.

This property applies only to your client application's use of the character; the setting does not affect other clients of the character or other characters of your client application.

> [!Note]  
> Building a Help file requires the Microsoft Windows Help Compiler.
