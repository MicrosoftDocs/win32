# Creating a New Sound File

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

When you first start the editor, you can create a new sound file by choosing **Record** from the **Audio** menu or clicking the **Record** button on the sound editor's toolbar, and then speaking into the microphone attached to your system. Click the **Stop** button on the toolbar to stop recording. You can select the **Play** command from the **Audio** menu or the toolbar to see how Microsoft Agent processes the sound file without linguistic enhancement. To create another new file, select New from the **File** menu or the toolbar.
