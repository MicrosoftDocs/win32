## Remarks

To support context-sensitive Help for the character, assign the context number to the character you use for the associated Help topic when you compile your Help file. This property applies only to the client of the character; the setting does not affect other clients of the character or other characters of the client.

If you've created a Windows Help file for your application and set the character's [**HelpFile**](helpfile-property.md) property, Agent automatically calls Help when [**HelpModeOn**](helpmodeon-property.md) is set to **True** and the user clicks the character. If there is a context number in the [**HelpContextID**](helpcontextid-property.md), Agent calls Help and searches for the topic identified by the current context number. The current context number is the value of **HelpContextID** for the character.

> [!Note]  
> Building a Help file requires the Microsoft Windows Help Compiler.
