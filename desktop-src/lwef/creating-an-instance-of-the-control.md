# Creating an Instance of the Control

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

Accessing Microsoft Agent's control requires that you first create an instance of the control. The easiest way to do this is to place an instance of the control on a form. You may have to add the control to your toolbox before adding it to your form. Depending on your programming language, you may also be able to create the control at runtime.
