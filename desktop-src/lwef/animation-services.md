# Animation Services

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

Microsoft Agent's animation services manage the animation and movement of a character's image in its own window on the screen. An animation is defined as a sequence of timed and optionally branched frames, composed of one or more images.
