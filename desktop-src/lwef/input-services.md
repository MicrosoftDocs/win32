# Input Services

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

A client application provides the primary user interface for interaction with a character. You can program a character to respond to any form of input, from button-clicks to typed-in text. In addition, Microsoft Agent provides events so you can program what happens when the user clicks, double-clicks, or drags the character. The server passes the coordinates of the pointer and any modifier key state for these events.
