## Remarks

This property indicates whether the character's frame is being displayed. It does not necessarily mean that there is an image on the screen. For example, this property returns **True** even when the character is positioned off the visible display area or when the current character frame contains no images. This property's setting applies to all clients of the character.

This property is read-only. To make a character visible or hidden, use the [**Show**](show-method.md) or [**Hide**](https://www.bing.com/search?q=**Hide**) methods.
