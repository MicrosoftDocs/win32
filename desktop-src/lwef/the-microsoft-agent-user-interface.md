# The Microsoft Agent User Interface

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

Microsoft Agent enables websites and conventional applications to include an enhanced form of user interaction. It provides several user interface components that enable users to access and interact with the character, know the character's status, and change global settings that affect all characters.

The following sections describe these basic elements of the Microsoft Agent user interface:

-   [The Character Window](the-character-window.md)
-   [The Character Taskbar Icon](the-character-taskbar-icon.md)
-   [The Voice Commands Window](the-voice-commands-window.md)
-   [The Word Balloon](the-word-balloon.md)
-   [The Listening Tip Window](the-listening-tip-window.md)
-   [The Advanced Character Options Window](the-advanced-character-options-window.md)
-   [The Default Character Properties Window](the-default-character-properties-window.md)
