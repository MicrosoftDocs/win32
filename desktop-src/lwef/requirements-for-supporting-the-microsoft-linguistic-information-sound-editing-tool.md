# Requirements for Supporting the Microsoft Linguistic Information Sound Editing Tool

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

The Microsoft Linguistic Information Sound Editing Tool uses a speech recognition engine to produce word breaks and phonetic information for standard Windows wave sound (.wav) files.
