# Using the Editor with a Different Speech Engine

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

While the sound editor installs the Microsoft Speech Recognition Engine (4.0), it may be used with another speech engine, if that engine supports the required interfaces documented in the Speech Engine Requirements document. Before attempting to use the editor with another engine, confirm with your vendor that they comply with these requirements.

To use the sound editor with another speech engine, choose the Speech Engine command on the **Edit** menu. This displays a dialog box showing the current engine in use. To choose another engine, display the list of engines, then click **OK**. If there are no other engines listed, then you do not have any other compatible engines included.
