# The Character Taskbar Icon

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

If a character has been authored to include an icon, the icon appears in the notification area of the taskbar when Microsoft Agent runs. This icon provides access to the character's pop-up menu, which provides access to Agent's global commands such as those that hide and show the character.

Moving the pointer over the taskbar icon displays a tip window that reflects the name of the character (in the current language of the system). Single-clicking the character's taskbar icon displays the character. The action associated with double-clicking the icon depends on the current application controlling that character.

Right-clicking the icon displays a pop-up menu. When the character is visible, the pop-up menu displays the same commands as those displayed when right-clicking the character. If the character is hidden, only the Open (or Close) Voice Commands Window and Show commands appear.
