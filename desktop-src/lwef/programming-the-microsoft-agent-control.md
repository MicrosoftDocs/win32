# Programming the Microsoft Agent Control

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

Although applications can write directly to the Microsoft Agent services using its automation server interfaces, Microsoft Agent also includes an ActiveX (OLE) control. The control supports easy programming using a scripting language such as Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) or other languages that support the ActiveX control interface.
