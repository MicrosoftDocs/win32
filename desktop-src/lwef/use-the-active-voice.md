# Use the Active Voice

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

When using speech output to provide directive information or to elicit a user response, use the active voice and clearly specify the user's expected action. The following example illustrates the differences:



| Directive                            |  Evaluation                   |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Let me repeat your number.           | No user action                |
| The number will be repeated.         | Passive voice, no user action |
| Listen while the number is repeated. | Passive voice                 |
| Listen to the repetition.            | Best choice                   |



 

In addition, construct your output to unfold the key information at the end of the phrase as shown in the following examples:



| Instead of this...                                                 | Use this                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| "Is three the next digit?"           | "Is the next digit three?"            |
| "Click OK to begin."                 | "To begin, click OK."                 |
| "Say 'Done' to complete your order." | "To complete your order, say 'Done.'" |
