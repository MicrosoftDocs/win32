## Remarks

If you define a [**Command**](/windows/desktop/lwef/the-command-object) object in a [**Commands**](https://www.bing.com/search?q=**Commands**) collection and set its [**Voice**](voice-property.md) property, you will typically also set its [**VoiceCaption**](voicecaption-property.md) property. This text will appear in the Voice Commands Window when your client application is input-active and the character is visible. If this property is not set, the setting for the [**Caption**](caption-property.md) property determines the text displayed. When neither the **VoiceCaption** nor **Caption** property is set, the command does not appear in the Voice Commands Window.
