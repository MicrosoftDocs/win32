*agent***.Name**

</dd> </dl>

## Remarks

In some programming environments such as Visual Basic, adding the control automatically generates a default name for the control that can be changed at design time. For HTML scripts, you can define the name in the <OBJECT> tag. If you define the name, follow the conventions of the programming language for defining object names.
