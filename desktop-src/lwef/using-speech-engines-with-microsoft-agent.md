# Using Speech Engines with Microsoft Agent

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

Microsoft provides a set of speech input (recognition) engines and speech output (tex-to-speech or TTS) engines you can use with your Microsoft Agent-enabled applications or webpages. Use of these engines is subject to the Microsoft Agent license agreement and the supplemental addendum displayed when you install the engines. This license entitles you to distribute the engines, but only when using them through Microsoft Agent API and using a visible character.

The sections here describe how to use speech engines with Microsoft Agent.
