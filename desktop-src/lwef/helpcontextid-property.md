## Remarks

If you've created a Windows Help file for your application and set the character's [**HelpFile**](helpfile-property.md) property, Agent automatically calls Help when [**HelpModeOn**](helpmodeon-property.md) is set to **True** and the user selects the [**Commands**](/windows/desktop/lwef/the-commands-collection-object) object. If you set a context number in the **HelpContextID**, Agent calls Help and searches for the topic identified by that context number.

This property applies only to your client application's use of the character; the setting does not affect other clients of the character or other characters of your client application.

> [!Note]  
> Building a Help file requires the Microsoft Windows Help Compiler.
