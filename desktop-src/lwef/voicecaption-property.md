## Remarks

If you set the [**Voice**](voice-property.md) property of your [**Commands**](/windows/desktop/lwef/the-commands-collection-object) collection, you will typically also set its **VoiceCaption** property. The **VoiceCaption** text setting appears in the Voice Commands Window when your client application is input-active and the character is visible. If this property is not set, the setting for the **Commands** collection's [**Caption**](caption-property.md) property determines the text displayed. When neither the **VoiceCaption** or **Caption** property is set, then commands in the collection appear in the Voice Commands Window under "(undefined command)" when your client application becomes input-active.

The **VoiceCaption** setting also determines the text displayed in the Listening Tip to indicate the commands for which the character listens.
