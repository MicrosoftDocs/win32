# Audio Output Support

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

Microsoft Agent enables you to use audio files for a character's spoken output. You can record audio files and use the [**Speak**](speak-method.md) method to play that data. Microsoft Agent animation services automatically support lip-syncing the character mouth by using the audio characteristics of the audio file. Microsoft Agent also supports a special format for audio files, which includes additional phoneme and word-break information for more enhanced lip-sync support. You can generate this special format using the Microsoft Linguistic Information Sound Editing Tool.
