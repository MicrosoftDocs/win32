# Agent Control Properties

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

The following properties are directly accessed from the Agent control:

-   [**Connected**](connected-property.md)
-   [**Name**](name-property-a.md)
-   [**RaiseRequestErrors**](raiserequesterrors-property.md)

In addition, some programming environments may assign additional design-time or run-time properties. For example, Visual Basic adds Left, Index, Tag, and Top properties that define the location of the control on a form even though the control does not appear on the form's page at run time.

The Suspended property is still supported for backward compatibility, but always returns **False** because the server no longer supports a suspended state.
