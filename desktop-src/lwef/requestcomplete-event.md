### Remarks

This event returns a [**Request**](/windows/desktop/lwef/the-request-object) object. Because requests are processed asynchronously, you can use this event to determine when the server completes processing a request (such as a [**Get**](get-method.md), [**Play**](play-method.md), or [**Speak**](speak-method.md) method) to synchronize this event with other actions generated by your application. The server sends the event only to the client that created the reference to the **Request** object and only if you defined a global variable for the request reference:


```
   Dim MyRequest 
   Dim Genie 

   Sub window_Onload
   
   Agent1.Characters.Load "Genie","https://agent.microsoft.com/characters/v2/genie/genie.acf"

   Set Genie = Agent.Characters("Genie")

   ' This syntax will generate RequestStart and RequestComplete events.
   Set MyRequest = Genie.Get("state", "Showing")
   ' This syntax will not generate RequestStart and RequestComplete events.
   Genie.Get "state", "Hiding"
   
   End Sub

   Sub Agent1_RequestComplete(ByVal Request)

   If Request = MyRequest Then
      Status = "Showing animation is now loaded"

   End Sub
```



Because animation [**Request**](/windows/desktop/lwef/the-request-object) objects don't get assigned until the server processes the request, make sure that the **Request** object exists before you attempt to evaluate it. For example, in Visual Basic, if you use a conditional to test whether a specific request was completed, you can use the **Nothing** keyword:


```
   Sub Agent1_RequestComplete (ByVal Request)

   If Not (MyRequest Is Nothing) Then
      If Request = MyRequest Then
      '-- Do whatever
      End If
   End If

   End Sub
```



> [!Note]  
> In VBScript 1.0, this event fires even if you don't define references to a [**Request**](/windows/desktop/lwef/the-request-object) object. This has been fixed in VBScript 2.0.
