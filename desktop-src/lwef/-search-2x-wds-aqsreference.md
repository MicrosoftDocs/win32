# Advanced Query Syntax

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Desktop Search 2.x is an obsolete technology that was originally available as an add-in for WindowsÂ XP and Windows Server 2003. On later releases, use [Windows Search](../search/-search-3x-wds-overview.md) instead.

The Advanced Query Syntax (AQS) is used by Microsoft Windows Desktop Search (WDS) to help users and programmers better define and narrow their searches. Using AQS is an easy way to narrow searches and deliver better result sets. Searches can be narrowed by the following parameters:

- File kinds: folders, documents, presentations, pictures and so on.
- File stores: specific databases and locations.
- File properties: size, date, title and so on.
- File contents: keywords like "project deliverables," "AQS," "blue suede shoes," and so on.

Furthermore, search parameters can be combined using search operators. The remainder of this section explains the query syntax, the parameters and operators, and how they can be combined to offer targeted search results. The tables describe the syntax to use with WDS, as well as the properties that can be queried for each file kind displayed in the **Windows Desktop Search** results window.

## Desktop Search Syntax

A search query can include one or more keywords, with Boolean operators and optional criteria. These optional criteria can narrow a search based on the following:

- Scope or data store in which files reside
- Kinds of files
- Managed properties of files

The optional criteria, described in greater detail following, use the following syntax:

`<scope name>:<value>`

`<file kind>:<value>`

`<property name>:<value>`

Suppose a user wants to search for a document containing the phrase "last quarter," created by John or Joanne, and that the user saved to the folder mydocuments. The query may look like this:

`"last quarter" author:(john OR joanne) foldername:mydocuments`

### Scope: Locations and Data Stores

Users can limit the scope of their searches to specific folder locations or data stores. For example, if you use several email accounts and you want to limit a query to either Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Outlook Express, you can use `store:outlook` or `store:oe` respectively.

| Restrict Search by Data Store | Use              | Example                                  |
|-------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Desktop                       | desktop          | store:desktop                            |
| Files                         | files            | store:files                              |
| Outlook                       | outlook          | store:outlook                            |
| Outlook Express               | oe               | store:oe                                 |
| Specific Folder               | foldername or in | foldername:MyDocuments or in:MyDocuments |

If you have a protocol handler in place to crawl custom stores, like Lotus Notes, you can use the name of the store or protocol handler for the store. For example, if you implemented a protocol handler to include a Lotus Notes data store as "notes," the query syntax would be `store:notes`.

### Common File Kinds

Users can also limit their searches to specific types of files, called file kinds. The following table lists the file kinds and offers examples of the syntax used to search for these kinds of files.

| To Restrict by File Type:       | Use              | Example                        |

| Notes                           | notes            | kind:notes                     |
| Documents                       | docs             | kind:docs                      |

| Programs                        | programs         | kind:programs                  |

### Boolean Operators

Search keywords and file properties can be combined to broaden or narrow a search with operators. The following table explains common operators used in a search query.

| Keyword/Symbol  | Examples | Function |
|---|---|----|
| NOT             | social NOT security<br/>                        | Finds items that contain *social*, but not *security*.<br/>                                              |
|                 | social  security<br/>                           | Finds items that contain *social* and *security*.<br/>                                              |
| OR              | social OR security<br/>                         | Finds items that contain *social* or *security*.<br/>                                                    |
| Quotation marks | "social security"<br/>                          | Finds items that contain the exact phrase *social security*.<br/>                                        |
| Parentheses     | (social security)<br/>                          | Finds items that contain *social* and *security* in any order.<br/>                                      |
| >            | date:>11/13/21<br/> size:>500<br/>  | Finds items with a date after MM/DD/YY. <br/> Finds items with a size greater than 500 bytes.<br/> |
| <            | date:<11/13/21 <br/> size:<500<br/> | Finds items with a date before MM/DD/YY. <br/> Finds items with a size less than 500 bytes.<br/>   |
| ..              | date:11/13/21..11/15/21<br/>                    | Finds items with a date beginning on MM/DD/YY and ending on MM/DD/YY.<br/>                               |

> [!Note]
> The operators **NOT** and **OR** must be in uppercase and cannot be combined in one query (e.g., `social OR security NOT retirement`).

### Boolean Properties

Some file types let users search for files using Boolean properties, as described in the following table.

| Property | Example | Function |
|---|---|---|
| is:attachment  | report is:attachment      | Finds items that have attachments that contain *report*. Same as `isattachment:true`.                           |
| isonline:      | report isonline:true      | Finds items that are online and which contain *report*.                                                         |
| isrecurring:   | report isrecurring:true   | Finds items that are recurring and which contain*report*.                                                       |
| isflagged:     | report isflagged:true     | Finds items that are flagged (Review, Follow up, for example) and which contain *report*.                       |
| isdeleted:     | report isdeleted:true     | Finds items that are flagged as deleted (Recycle Bin or Deleted Items, for example) and which contain *report*. |
| iscompleted:   | report iscompleted:false  | Finds items that are not flagged as complete and which contain *report*.                                        |
| hasattachment: | report hasattachment:true | Finds items containing *report* and having attachments                                                          |
| hasflag:       | report hasflag:true       | Finds items containing *report* and having flags.                                                                |

### Dates

In addition to searching on specific dates and date ranges using the operators described earlier, AQS allows relative date values (like `today`, `tomorrow`, or `next week`) and day (like `Tuesday` or `Monday..Wednesday`) and month (`February`) values.

| Relative to:    | Syntax Example | Result |
|----|---|---|
| Day | date:today<br/> date:tomorrow<br/> date:yesterday<br/> | Finds items with today's date.<br/> Finds items with tomorrow's date.<br/> Finds items with yesterday's date. <br/> |
| Week/Month/year | date:this week<br/> date:last week<br/> date:next month<br/> date:past month<br/> date:coming year <br/> | Finds items with a date falling within the current week.<br/> Finds items with a date falling within the previous week.<br/> Finds items with a date falling within the upcoming week.<br/> Finds items with a date falling within the previous month.<br/> Finds items with a date falling within the upcoming year. <br/> |

## Properties by File Kind

Users can search on specific properties of different file kinds. Some properties (like file size) are common to all files, while others are limited to a specific kind. Slide count, for example, is specific to presentations. The following tables list these properties by file kind.

### File Kind: Everything

These are properties common to all file kinds. To include all types of files in a query, the syntax is:

`kind:everything <property>:<value>`

where `<property>` is a property listed below and `<value>` is the user-specified search term.

| Property       | Use                      | Example                        |
