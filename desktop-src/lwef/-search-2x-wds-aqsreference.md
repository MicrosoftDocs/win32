# Advanced Query Syntax

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Desktop Search 2.x is an obsolete technology that was originally available as an add-in for WindowsÂ XP and Windows Server 2003. On later releases, use [Windows Search](../search/-search-3x-wds-overview.md) instead.

Microsoft Windows Desktop Search (WDS) uses Advanced Query Syntax (AQS) to help users and programmers better define and narrow their searches. Using AQS is an easy way to deliver more meaningful result sets. Searches can be narrowed by the following parameters:

- File kinds: File types, such as folders, documents, presentations, pictures, and so on.
- File stores: Specific databases and locations.
- File properties: File metadata, such as size, date, and title.
- File contents: Keywords like *project deliverables*, *AQS*, *blue suede shoes*, and so on.

Furthermore, you can combine search parameters by using search operators. The remainder of this section explains query syntax, parameters and operators, and how they can be combined to offer targeted search results. The tables describe the syntax to use with WDS, and the properties that can be queried for each file kind displayed in the **Windows Desktop Search** results window.

## Desktop search syntax

A search query can include one or more keywords, with Boolean operators and optional criteria. You can use these optional criteria to refine a search with the following syntax:

- `<scope name>:<value>`: Location or data store in which files reside
- `<file kind>:<value>`: Kinds of files
- `<property name>:<value>`: Managed properties of files

Suppose a user wants to search for a document containing the phrase *last quarter*, created by John or Joanne, and saved to the folder *mydocuments*. The query might look like this:

`"last quarter" author:(john OR joanne) foldername:mydocuments`

### Scope by location and data store

Users can limit the scope of their searches to specific folder locations or data stores. For example, if you use several email accounts, and you want to limit a query to Microsoft Outlook, use `store:outlook`.

| Location or data store        | AQS Keyword      | Example                                  |
|-------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Desktop                       | desktop          | store:desktop                            |
| Files                         | files            | store:files                              |
| Outlook                       | outlook          | store:outlook                            |
| Outlook Express               | oe               | store:oe                                 |
| Specific folder               | foldername or in | foldername:MyDocuments or in:MyDocuments |

If you have a protocol handler in place to crawl custom stores, like Lotus Notes, you can use the name of the store or protocol handler for the data store. For example, if you implemented a protocol handler to include a Lotus Notes data store as "notes," the query syntax would be `store:notes`.

### File kinds

Users can limit their searches to specific kinds of files, also called file types. The following table lists the file kinds and offers examples of the AQS syntax used to search for these kinds of files.

| File kind to search             | AQS Keyword      | Example                        |
|---------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|

| E-mail                          | email            | kind:email                     |
| Instant Messenger conversations | im               | kind:im                        |

| Tasks                           | tasks            | kind:tasks                     |
| Notes                           | notes            | kind:notes                     |
| Documents                       | docs             | kind:docs                      |
| Text documents                  | text             | kind:text                      |

| Pictures                        | pics             | kind:pics                      |
| Videos                          | videos           | kind:videos                    |
| Folders                         | folders          | kind:folders                   |
| Folder name                     | foldername or in | foldername:mydocs or in:mydocs |

| Programs                        | programs         | kind:programs                  |

### Boolean operators

Users can combine search keywords and file properties with operators to broaden or narrow a search. The following table describes common search query operators.

| Operator  | Example | Result |
|-----------------|----------|----------|
| NOT             | social NOT security | Finds items that contain *social*, but not *security*. |
| Space           | social  security    | Finds items that contain *social* and *security*. |
| OR              | social OR security  | Finds items that contain *social* or *security*. |
| Quotation marks | "social security"   | Finds items that contain the exact phrase *social security*. |
| Parentheses     | (social security)   | Finds items that contain *social* and *security* in any order. |
| >               | date:>11/13/21<br/> size:>500<br/>  | Finds items with a date after MM/DD/YY. <br/> Finds items with a size greater than 500 bytes.<br/> |
| <               | date:<11/13/21 <br/> size:<500<br/> | Finds items with a date before MM/DD/YY. <br/> Finds items with a size less than 500 bytes.<br/> |
| ..              | date:11/13/21..11/15/21 | Finds items with a date beginning on MM/DD/YY and ending on MM/DD/YY. |

> [!NOTE]
> The operators **NOT** and **OR** must be in uppercase and can't be combined in the same query. For example, `social OR security NOT retirement` is not allowed.

### Boolean properties

Some file types let users search for files by using Boolean properties, as described in the following table.

| Property syntax | Example | Result |
|---|---|---|
| is:attachment  | report is:attachment      | Finds items that have attachments that contain *report*. Same as `isattachment:true`.                           |
| isonline:      | report isonline:true      | Finds items that are online and which contain *report*.                                                         |
| isrecurring:   | report isrecurring:true   | Finds items that are recurring and which contain *report*.                                                       |
| isflagged:     | report isflagged:true     | Finds items that are flagged (for example, Review, Follow up) and which contain *report*.                       |
| isdeleted:     | report isdeleted:true     | Finds items that are flagged as deleted (for example, moved to the Recycle Bin or deleted items) and which contain *report*. |
| iscompleted:   | report iscompleted:false  | Finds items that are not flagged as complete and which contain *report*.                                        |
| hasattachment: | report hasattachment:true | Finds items that contain *report* and have attachments                                                          |
| hasflag:       | report hasflag:true       | Finds items that contain *report* and have flags.                                                                |

### Dates

In addition to being able to search on specific dates and date ranges with the operators described previously, AQS allows relative date values (like `today`, `tomorrow`, or `next week`), day values (such as `Tuesday` or `Monday..Wednesday`), and month values (such as `February`).

| Date relative to: | Example | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Day | date:today<br/> date:tomorrow<br/> date:yesterday<br/> | Finds items with today's date.<br/> Finds items with tomorrow's date.<br/> Finds items with yesterday's date. <br/> |
| Week/Month/Year | date:this week<br/> date:last week<br/> date:next month<br/> date:past month<br/> date:coming year <br/> | Finds items with a date falling within the current week.<br/> Finds items with a date falling within the previous week.<br/> Finds items with a date falling within the upcoming week.<br/> Finds items with a date falling within the previous month.<br/> Finds items with a date falling within the upcoming year. <br/> |

## Properties by file kind

Users can search on specific properties of different file kinds. Some properties (like file size) are common to all files, while others are limited to a specific kind. Slide count, for example, is specific to presentations. The following tables list these properties by file kind.

### Everything

These properties are common to all file kinds. To include all types of files in a query, use this syntax:

`kind:everything <property>:<value>`

where `<property>` is an AQS property keyword from the following table and `<value>` is the specified search term.
