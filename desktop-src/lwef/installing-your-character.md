# Installing Your Character

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

For your character to show in the Assistant Gallery, install it in the Microsoft\\Office\\Actors folder inside of the user's Application Data folder. The Application Data folder can be found in the Windows directory or in the User Profiles directory inside of the Windows directory. For example, in Windows 2000, you might install your character in "C:\\Documents and Settings\\YourLoginName\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Office\\Actors".
