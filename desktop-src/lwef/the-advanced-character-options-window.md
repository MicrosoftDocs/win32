# Advanced Character Options Window (Microsoft Agent User Interface)

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

Microsoft Agent maintains certain global settings that enable a user to control interaction with all characters. The Advanced Character Options window displays these options and their current settings, and can be shown by any hosting application using the Microsoft Agent programming interface. Microsoft Agent remembers the last page viewed and displays that page when the property sheet appears.
