# Creating a Notification Sink

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

To be notified of events by Microsoft Agent, you must implement either the [**IAgentNotifySink**](events.md)or the [**IAgentNotifySinkEx**](iagentnotifysinkex.md) interface, and create and register an object of that type following COM conventions:


```
// Create a notification sink

pSinkEx = new AgentNotifySinkEx;

pSinkEx->AddRef();

// And register it with Microsoft Agent

hRes = pAgentEx->Register((IUnknown *)pSinkEx, &lNotifySinkID);
```



Remember to unregister your notification sink when your application shuts down and releases Microsoft Agent's interfaces.
