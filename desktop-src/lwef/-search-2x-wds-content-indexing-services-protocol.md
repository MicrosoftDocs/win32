### 1.1 Glossary

> [!Note]  
> The following terms are defined in the Glossary section of \[MS-SYS\]:
>
> -   GUID
> -   Little Endian
> -   Named Pipe
> -   Path

 

**Binding**: A request to include a particular **column** in a returned **rowset** . The **binding** specifies a property to be included in the search results.

**Bookmark**: A marker that uniquely identifies a row within a set of rows.

**Catalog**: The highest-level unit of organization in the indexing service. It represents a set of indexed documents against which queries can be executed using the Content Indexing Service Protocol.

**Category**: A hierarchical grouping of rows. For example, a query result containing author and title columns can be categorized based on author. Each group of rows containing the same value for author would constitute a category.

**Chapter** : A range of **rows** within a set of **rows** .

**Column**: The container for a single type of information in a **row** . Columns map to property names, and specify which properties are used for the search query's **command** **tree** elements.

**Command Tree**: A combination of **restrictions** , **categories** , and **sort orders** specified for the search query.

**Cursor**: An entity that is used as a mechanism to work with one **row** or a small block of **rows** at a time in a set of data returned in a result set. A **cursor** is positioned on a single **row** within the result set. After the **cursor** is positioned on a row, operations can be performed on that **row** , or on a block of **rows** starting at that position.

**Handle**: A token that can be used to identify and access **cursors** , **chapters** , and **bookmarks** .

**Index**: A persistent structure that contains the text content pulled out of files by an **indexing service** . This includes the list of words, which are stored along with the containing file name, word location, and **locale** .

**Indexing**: The process of extracting text and properties from files and storing the extracted values into the **indexes** (for text), and the **property cache** (for properties).

**Indexing Service**: A service that creates indexed **catalogs** for the contents and properties of file systems. Applications can search the catalogs for information from the files on the indexed file system.

**Locale**: An identifier, as specified in \[MS-GPSI\] Appendix A, that specifies preferences related to language. These preferences indicate how dates and times are to be formatted, items are to be sorted alphabetically, strings are to be compared, and so on.

**Natural Language Query**: A query constructed using human language instead of query syntax.

**Noise word**: A word that is ignored by the indexing service when present in the **restrictions** specified for the search query because it has little discriminatory value. English examples include "a", "and" and "the".

**Property Cache**: A cache of file properties extracted by an **indexing service** .

**Property Indexing**: The process of creating an **index** of **value-type properties** of a document, including author, subject, type, word count, printed page count, and any other properties.

**Restriction**: A set of conditions that a file must meet to be included in the search results returned by the **indexing service** in response to a search query. A **restriction** narrows the focus of a search query, limiting the files that the **indexing service** will include in the search results to only those that match the conditions.

**Row**: The collection of **columns** , containing the property values that describe a single file from the set of files that matched the **restrictions** specified in the search query submitted to the **indexing service** .

**Rowset**: A set of **rows** returned in the search results.

**Sort Order**: The set of rules in a search query that define the ordering of rows in the search result. Each rule consists of a property (name, size, etc.) and a direction for the ordering (ascending or descending). Multiple rules are applied sequentially

**Text-type Property**: A property that describes the content of a document and has only unformatted text associated with its name.

**Value-type Property**: A property that describes a single attribute of an entire document. A value-type property has a data type ID and a value of that data type associated with its name.

**Virtual Root**: An alternate path to a folder. A physical folder can have zero or more virtual roots. Paths beginning with a virtual root are called virtual paths. For example, /server/vanityroot might be a virtual root of C:\\IIS\\web\\folder1. Then the file C:\\IIS\\web\\folder1\\default.htm would have a virtual path of /server/vanityroot/default.htm.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT**: These terms (in all caps) are used as described in \[RFC2119\]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

### 1.3 Protocol Overview (Synopsis)

A content **indexing service** helps efficiently organize the extracted features of a collection of documents. The Content Indexing Service Protocol (CISP) allows a client to communicate with a server hosting an indexing service to issue queries and to allow an administrator to manage the indexing server.

When processing files, an indexing service analyzes a set of documents and reorganizes their content in such a way that **properties** of those documents can be efficiently returned in response to queries. A collection of documents that can be queried comprises a **catalog** . A catalog may contain an **index** (for quick reference to text) and a **property cache** (for quick retrieval of property values).

Conceptually, a catalog consists of a logical "table" of properties with the text or value and corresponding locale stored in **columns** of the table. Each "row" of the table corresponds to a separate document in the scope of the catalog and each "column" of the table corresponds to a property.

The specific tasks performed by CISP are grouped into two functional areas:

-   Remote administration of indexing service catalogs,
-   Remote querying of indexing service catalogs.

### 1.3.1 Remote Administration Tasks

CISP enables the following indexing service catalog management tasks from a client:

-   Query the current state of an indexing service catalog on the server.
-   Update the state of an indexing service catalog.
-   Launch the indexing process for a particular set of files.
-   Initiate optimization of an index in order to improve query performance.

All remote administration tasks follow a simple request/response model. No state is maintained on the client for any administration call and administrative calls can be made in any order.

### 1.3.2 Remote Querying

CISP enables clients to perform search queries against a remote server hosting an indexing service.

Sending a search query is a multi-step process initiated by the client. The steps are as follows:

1.  The client requests a connection to a server hosting an indexing service.
2.  The client sends the parameters for the search query, which include:
    -   The **restrictions** to specify which documents are to be included and/or excluded from the search results.
    -   The order in which the search results are to be returned.
    -   The columns to be returned in the result set.
    -   The maximum number of **rows** that should be returned for the query.
    -   The maximum time for query execution.

        Once the server has acknowledged the client's request to initiate the query, the client can request status information about the query, but this is not a required step.

3.  The client then specifies which properties the server should include in the search results.
4.  The client requests a result set from the server, and the server responds by sending the client the property values for files that were included in the results for the client's search query. If the value of a property is too large to fit in a single response buffer the server will not send the property but instead will set the property status to deferred. The client then requests the property value separately using a series of requests for successive chunks of the value, and then resumes requesting other values.
5.  Once the client is finished with the search query and no longer requires additional results, the client contacts the server to release the query.
6.  Once the server has released the query, the client may send a request to disconnect from the server. The connection is then closed. Alternatively, the client may issue another query and repeat the sequence from the step 2.

Windows Behavior: This protocol is implemented on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista.

### 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The CISP relies on the SMB \[MS-SMB\] protocol for message transport. No other protocol depends directly on the Content Indexing Service Protocol.

*Windows Behavior: Applications typically interact with an OLE DB interface wrapper \[MSDN-OLEDB\] (e.g., a protocol client) and not directly with the protocol.*

### 1.5 Prerequisites and Preconditions

It is assumed that the client has obtained the name of the server and a catalog name before this protocol is invoked. How a client does this is outside of the scope of this specification.

It is also assumed that the client and server have a security association usable with named pipes \[MS-SMB\].

### 1.6 Applicability Statement

CISP is designed for querying and managing catalogs on a remote server from a client. CISP is deprecated on Windows Vista.

### 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This protocol has no versioning or capability negotiation mechanisms.

### 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol uses HRESULTs which are vendor-extensible. Vendors are free to choose their own values for this field, as long as the C bit (0x20000000) is set as specified in Section 4.1.1 of \[MS-SYS\], indicating it is a customer code.

This protocol also uses NTSTATUS values taken from the NTSTATUS number space defined in \[MS-SYS\]. Vendors SHOULD reuse those values with their indicated meaning. Choosing any other value runs the risk of a collision in the future.

*Windows Behavior: Windows only uses the values specified in Section 4.1.3 of \[MS-SYS\].*

### 1.8.1 Property IDs

Properties are represented by IDs known as Property IDs. Each property must have a globally unique identifier. This identifier consists of a **GUID** representing a collection of properties called a property set plus either a string or 32-bit integer to identify the property within the set. If the integer form of ID is used, then the values 0x00000000, 0xFFFFFFFF and 0xFFFFFFFE are considered invalid.

Vendors can guarantee their properties are uniquely defined by placing them in a property set defined by their own GUID.

### 1.9 Standards Assignments

This protocol has no standards assignments, only private assignments made by Microsoft using allocation procedures specified in other protocols.

Microsoft has allocated this protocol a named pipe as specified in \[MS-SMB\]. The assignment is:



| Parameter | Value             | Reference  |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Pipe name | \\pipe\\CI\_SKADS | \[MS-SMB\] |



 

## 2 Messages

-   [2.1 Transport](#21-transport)
-   [2.2 Message Syntax](#22-message-syntax)

### 2.1 Transport

All messages MUST be transported using a named pipe, as specified in \[MS-SMB\]. The following pipe name is used:

-   \\pipe\\CI\_SKADS

This protocol uses the underlying SMB named pipe protocol to retrieve the identity of the caller that made the connection as specified in Section 2.2.8 of \[MS-SMB\]; the client MUST set SECURITY\_IDENTIFICATION as the ImpersonationLevel in the request to open the named pipe.

### 2.2 Message Syntax

Several structures and messages in the following sections refer to chapter or bookmark handles. A handle is a 32-bit long opaque structure which uniquely identifies a chapter or bookmark. Typically, client applications receive handle values via method calls; however there are several well known values which need not be obtained from a server, the meaning of which is specified in the following table:



| Value                         | Meaning                                                                      |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DB\_NULL\_HCHAPTER 0x00000000 | A chapter handle to the unchaptered rowset, containing all query results.    |
| DBBMK\_FIRST 0x00000001       | A bookmark handle to a bookmark that identifies the first row in the rowset. |
| DBBMK\_LAST 0x00000002        | A bookmark handle to a bookmark that identifies the last row in the rowset.  |



 

### 2.2.1 Structures

### 2.2.1.1.1 CBaseStorageVariant Structures

The following structures are used in the CBaseStorageVariant structure.

### 2.2.1.1.1.1 DECIMAL

DECIMAL is used to represent an exact numeric value with a fixed precision and fixed scale.

When vType is set to VT\_DECIMAL (0x0000E), the vData1 and vData2 fields of CBaseStorageVariant MUST be interpreted as follows:

**vData1**: The number of digits to the right of the decimal point. MUST be in the range 0 to 28.

**vData2**: The sign of the numeric value. Set to 0x00 if positive, 0x80 if negative.

vVectorElements

vVectorData



 

**vVectorElements**: Unsigned 32-bit integer, indicating the number of elements in the vVectorData field.

**vVectorData**: An array of items which have a type indicated by vType with the 0x1000 bit cleared. The size of an individual fixed-length item can be obtained from the fixed-length data type table, as specified in Section 2.2.1.1. The length of this field, in bytes, can be calculated by multiplying vVectorElements by the size of individual item.

For variable-length data types vVectorData contains a sequence of consecutively marshaled simple types where the type is indicated by vType with the 0x1000 bit cleared. This includes a special case indicated by vType VT\_ARRAY \| VT\_VARIANT (i.e., 0x100C).

The elements in the vVectorData field MUST be separated by 0 to 3 padding bytes such that each element begins at an offset that is a multiple of 4 bytes from the beginning of the message that contains this array. If padding bytes are present, the value they contain is arbitrary. The content of the padding bytes MUST be ignored by the receiver.

For a vType set to VT\_ARRAY \| VT\_VARIANT, the type for items in this sequence is CBaseStorageVariant.

### 2.2.1.1.1.3 SAFEARRAY

SAFEARRAY is used to pass multidimensional arrays. The structure contains array size information as well as the data in the array.

cbElements

Rgsabound (variable)

vData (variable)



 

**cDims**: Unsigned 16-bit integer, indicating the number of dimensions of the multidimensional array.

**fFeatures**: A 16-bit bitfield. The values represent features, defined by upper layer applications and MUST be ignored.

**cbElements**: A 32-bit unsigned integer specifying the size of each element of the array.

**Rgsabound**: An array that contains one SAFEARRAYBOUND structure, as specified in section 2.2.1.1.1.4, per dimension in the SAFEARRAY. This array has left-most dimension first, and right-most dimension last.

**vData**: A vector of marshaled items of a particular type, indicated by the vType of the containing CBaseStorageVariant, with the bit 0x2000 cleared.

vData is marshaled similarly to VT\_VECTOR, as specified in Section 2.2.1.1.1.2, with the difference that the number of items is not stored in front of the vector. Rather the number of items is calculated by multiplying the cElements value with all safe array bounds given in the Rgsabound field. Elements are stored in a vector in order of dimensions, iterating beginning with the right-most dimension.

The following diagram visually represents a sample two-dimensional array. The first dimension has cElements equal to 4 (represented horizontally) and lLbound equal to 0, and the second dimension has cElements equal to 2 (represented vertically) and lLbound equal to 0.

    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
        0x00000017
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

Using the diagram above, vData will contain the following sequence: 0x00000001, 0x00000007, 0x00000002, 0x00000011, 0x00000003, 0x00000013, 0x00000005, 0x00000017 (iterating through the rightmost dimension first, then incrementing the next dimension). The preceding Rgsabound (which records cElements and Lbound) would be: 0x00000004, 0x00000000, 0x00000002, 0x00000000.

**cFilteredDocuments**: A 32-bit unsigned integer indicating the number of documents indexed since content indexing was begun.

**cTotalDocuments**: A 32-bit unsigned integer indicating the total number of documents in the system.

**cPendingScans**: A 32-bit unsigned integer indicating the number of pending high level indexing operations. The meaning of this value is provider-specific but larger numbers are expected to indicate more indexing remains.

*Windows Behavior*: This value is usually zero, except immediately after indexing has been started or after a notification queue overflows.

**dwIndexSize**: A 32-bit unsigned integer indicating the size, in megabytes, of the index (excluding the property cache).

**cUniqueKeys**: A 32-bit unsigned integer indicating the approximate number of unique keys in the catalog.

| Value                         | Meaning                                                  |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| eRowsSeekNone 0x00000000      | No SeekDescription, ignore SeekDescription field.        |
| eRowSeekNext 0x00000001       | SeekDescription contains a CRowSeekNext structure.       |
| eRowSeekAt 0x00000002         | SeekDescription contains a CRowSeekAt structure.         |
| eRowSeekAtRatio 0x00000003    | SeekDescription contains a CRowSeekAtRatio structure.    |
| eRowSeekByBookmark 0x00000004 | SeekDescription contains a CRowSeekByBookmark structure. |



 

**\_chapt**: A 32-bit value representing the handle of the rowset chapter.

**SeekDescription**: This field MUST contain a structure of the type indicated by the eType field.

**paddingRows**: This field MUST be of sufficient length (0 to \_cbReserved-1 bytes) to pad the Rows field to \_cbReserved offset from the beginning of a message, where \_cbReserved is the value in the CPMGetRowsIn message. Padding bytes used in this field can be any arbitrary value. This field MUST be ignored by the receiver.

**Rows**: Row data, is formatted as prescribed by column information in the most recent CPMSetBindingsIn message. Rows MUST be stored in forward order (e.g. row 1 before row 2).

Fixed-sized columns MUST be stored at the offsets specified by the most recent CPMSetBindingsIn message.

Variable-sized columns (e.g., strings) MUST be stored as follows:

-   The variable data itself (e.g. the string) is stored near the end of the buffer in descending order (e.g. the collection of all variable data for row 1 is at the end, row 2 next closest, etc.).
-   The fixed sized area (at the beginning of the row buffer) MUST contain a CRowVariant for each column, stored at the offset specified in the most recent CPMSetBindingsIn message. vType MUST contain the data type (ex: VT\_LPWSTR). If, as determined by the rules at the beginning of section this section, 32-bit offsets are being used then the Offset field in CRowVariant MUST contain a 32-bit value that is the offset of the variable data from the beginning of the CPMGetRowsOut message, plus the value of \_ulClientBase specified in the most recent CPMGetRowsIn message. If 64-bit offsets are being used then the Offset field in CRowVariant MUST contain a 64-bit value that is the offset from the beginning of the CPMGetRowsOut message, added to a 64-bit value composed by using \_ulClientBase as the low 32-bits and \_ulReserved2 as the high 32-bits.

For example, if the CPMSetBindingsIn message specified two columns-Size (VT\_I4) and Title (VT\_LPWSTR)-and \_ulClientBase from CPMGetRowsIn was 0x10000 then two rows would appear as follows. The section marked in grey is the fixed-length part of the buffer.

### 2.2.3.30 CPMDisconnect

The CPMDisconnect message ends the connection with the server

The message MUST NOT include a body; only the message header, as specified in Section 2.2.2 is to be sent.

### 2.2.4 Errors

All Content Indexing Service Protocol messages MUST return 0x00000000 on success; otherwise, they return a 32-bit nonzero error code which can be either an HRESULT or an NTSTATUS value (see section 1.8). If a buffer is too small to fit a result, a status code of STATUS\_INSUFFICIENT\_RESOURCES (0xC0000009A) MUST be returned and the failing operation should be retried with a larger buffer.

All other error values MUST be treated the same.

(Note that currently the HRESULT and NTSTATUS numbering spaces do not overlap except with values of identical meaning, but even if they were to be conflicts in the future, it would not cause any protocol issues as long as the value for STATUS\_INSUFFICIENT\_RESOURCES remains unique, since all other error values are treated the same.)

## 3 Protocol Details

-   [3.1 Server Details](#31-server-details)
-   [3.2 Client Details](#32-client-details)

CISP message requests for remotely querying the indexing service catalogs do not require any particular sequence. It is advised that the higher layer adhere to a meaningful message sequence though, as for messages that are received out of this sequence or with invalid data, the server will respond with an error. Some messages are also dependent on the higher layer providing valid data that was received in messages earlier in the sequence.

A typical message sequence for a simple query from a client to a remote computer is illustrated in the following diagram.

![message sequence for simple query](images/protocoldetails.jpg)

The messages represented in the preceding diagram represent a subset of all of the CISP messages used for querying a remote indexing service catalog.

### 3.1 Server Details

### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

The following section specifies data and state maintained by the CISP server. The data provided here is to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This section does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

An indexing service implementing the CISP MUST maintain the following abstract data elements:

-   The list of clients connected to the server
-   Information about each client, which includes:
-   -   Client's version (as indicated in the CPMConnectIn message specified in section 2.2.3.6)
    -   Catalog associated with the client (by a CPMConnectIn message)
    -   Additional client properties as specified in section 2.2.1.21.1.
    -   Client's search query
    -   List of cursor handles for the query and position in result set for each handle.
    -   Current set of bindings
    -   Current status of the query which includes (for each cursor):
    -   -   Number of rows in query result
        -   Numerator and denominator of query completion
        -   Last number of rows, reported by most recent CPMRatioFinishedOut message for this cursor
        -   Whether the query is monitored by the server for changes in query results and if it is monitored, what changed in the query results since it was last reported to client by CPMSendNotifyOut
        -   List of chapters handles, served by this query to a client.
        -   List of bookmark handles for each cursor, served by this query to a client.

-   The current state of the indexing service, which may be "not initialized", "running", or "shutting down". Note that most of the time server is in "running" state. Following is the state machine diagram for the server:

    ![state machine diagram of indexing service server](images/abstractdatamodel.jpg)

-   Per-catalog information: number of documents indexed, size of index, number of unique keys, etc (see section 2.2.3.1 for complete list), state (which corresponds to the values of dwNewState in section 2.2.3.2).
-   For each language supported, a database of word variations as discussed in section 2.2.1.3.

### 3.1.2 Timers

No protocol timers are required.

### 3.1.3 Initialization

Upon initialization, the server MUST set its state to "not initialized" and start listening for messages on the named pipe specified in section 1.9. After doing any other internal initialization, it MUST transition to the "running" state.

### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

None.

### 3.1.5 Message Processing and Sequencing Rules

Whenever there is an error occurs during processing of a message sent by a client the server MUST report an error back to the client as follows:

-   Stop processing the message sent by the client
-   Respond with the message header (only) of the message sent by the client, keeping \_msg field intact.
-   Set the \_status field to the error code value.

When a message arrives, the server MUST check the \_msg field value to see if it is a known type (see section 2.2.2). If the type is not known, it MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.

The server MUST then validate the \_ulChecksum field value if the message type is one of the following:

-   CPMConnectIn (0x000000C8)
-   CPMCreateQueryIn (0x000000CA)
-   CPMSetBindingsIn (0x000000D0)
-   CPMGetRowsIn (0x000000CC)
-   CPMFetchValueIn (0x000000E4)

To validate the \_ulChecksum field value, the server MUST check the value the client specified in the \_iClientVersion field in the CPMConnectIn message.

If the \_iClientVersion field is not set to 0x00000008 and the \_ulChecksum field is not set to 0x00000000, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error. Server MUST NOT validate the \_ulChecksum field for clients the set the \_iClientVersion field to a value less than 0x00000008.

If the \_iClientVersionfield field value is 0x00000008 or greater, the server MUST validate that the \_ulChecksum field was calculated as specified in section 3.2.4. If the \_ulChecksum value is invalid, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.

Next, the server checks which state is it in. If its state is "not initialized" the server MUST report a CI\_E\_NOT\_INITIALIZED (0x8004180B) error. If the state is "shutting down" the server MUST report a CI\_E\_SHUTDOWN (0x80041812) error.

Once a header has been determined to be valid and the server to be in "running" state, further message-specific processing MUST be done as specified in the subsections below.

### 3.1.5.1 Remote Indexing Service Catalog Management

### 3.1.5.1.1 Receiving a CPMCiStateInOut Request

When the server receives a CPMCIStateInOut message request from the client, the server MUST first check if the client is in a list of connected clients. If client is not in the list, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error. Otherwise, it MUST respond to the client with a CPMCIStateInOut message, filling it in with information about the client's associated catalog as specified in Section 2.2.3.1.

### 3.1.5.1.2 Receiving a CPMSetCatStateIn Request

When the server receives a CPMSetCatStateIn message request from the client, the server MUST do the following:

-   Check that client has administrative access. If the client does not have administrative access, the server MUST report a STATUS\_ACCESS\_DENIED (0xC0000022) error.
-   If \_dwNewState is not equal to CICAT\_ALL\_OPENED then change the state of the catalog specified in the CatName field as specified by the \_dwNewState field. See Section 2.2.3.2 for more details. If the server does not locate a catalog with the name specified in the CatName field, the server MUST return a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.
-   Respond to the client with a CPMSetCatStateOut message, where \_dwOldState MUST be set to the previous state of the catalog. If \_dwNewState is equal to CICAT\_ALL\_OPENED the server MUST check the status of all catalogs and if all of them are started it MUST set \_dwOldState to 0x00000001, and otherwise set \_dwOldState to 0x00000000.

### 3.1.5.1.3 Receiving a CPMUpdateDocumentsIn Request

When the server receives a CPMUpdateDocumentsIn message request, the server MUST do the following:

-   Check if the client is in a list of connected clients (which have a catalog associated). If client is not in the list, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.
-   Check that client has administrative access. If the client does not have administrative access to the server, the server MUST report a STATUS\_ACCESS\_DENIED (0xC0000022) error.
-   Begin the process of indexing the path specified by the client, doing a full or incremental scan, depending on value of \_flag field in CPMUpdateDocumentsIn message. If the path was not previously indexed, it MUST be added to the collection of indexed locations and a full scan performed. If an illegal value of the \_flag field is specified, the server MUST act as if \_flag was set to UPD\_INIT and perform a full scan. This operation MUST be performed in the catalog associated with the client.
-   Respond to the client with the message header for the CPMUpdateDocumentsIn, and set the \_status field to the results of the request.

### 3.1.5.1.4 Receiving a CPMForceMergeIn Request

When the server receives a CPMForceMergeIn message request, the server MUST do the following:

-   Check if the client is in a list of connected clients (which have a catalog associated). If client is not in the list the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.
-   Check that client has administrative access. If the client does not have administrative access, the server MUST report a STATUS\_ACCESS\_DENIED (0xC0000022) error.
-   Begin any process of maintenance necessary to improve query performance on a catalog, associated with the client.
-   Respond to the client with a message header for the CPMForceMergeIn, and set the \_status field to the results of the request.

Note that process of maintenance is asynchronous and can continue after client receives the response message. This process does not directly impact the protocol in any way (other than response time).

### 3.1.5.2 Remote Indexing Service Querying

### 3.1.5.2.1 Receiving a CPMConnectIn Request

When the server receives a CPMConnectIn request from a client, the server MUST do the following:

-   Check if the client is in the list of connected clients. If this is the case, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.
-   Checks if the specified catalog exists and not in the stopped state. If this is not the case then the server MUST a report CI\_E\_NO\_CATALOG (0x8004181D) error.
-   Add the client to the list of connected clients.
-   Associate the catalog with the client.
-   Store the information passed in the CPMConnectIn message (such as catalog name, client version, etc.) in the client state.
-   Respond to the client with a CPMConnectOut message.

### 3.1.5.2.2 Receiving a CPMCreateQueryIn Request

When the server receives a CPMCreateQueryIn message request from a client, the server MUST do the following:

-   Check if the client is in the list of connected clients. If this is not the case, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.
-   Check if the client already has a query associated with it. If this is the case, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.
-   Check if the catalog associated with the client is in state which allows query to be processed (CICAT\_READONLY or CICAT\_WRITABLE). If this is not the case, the server MUST report a QUERY\_S\_NO\_QUERY (0x8004160C) error.
-   Parse the restriction set, sort orders, and groupings specified in the query. If the server encounters an error, it MUST report an appropriate error. If this step fails for any other reason, the server MUST report the error encountered. For information about indexing service query errors, see \[MSDN-QUERYERR\].
-   Save the search query in the state for the client.
-   Make any preparations needed to serve rows to a client and associate the query with appropriate cursor handles (depending on information passed in CPMCreateQueryIn message).
-   Add those handles to client's list of cursor handles, and initialize lists of chapter handles and bookmarks.
-   Initialize list of chapter handles for every cursor in this query to DB\_NULL\_HCHAPTER
-   Initialize list of bookmark handles for every cursor in this query to a set of DBBMK\_FIRST and DBBMK\_LAST.
-   Mark the query as not monitored for changes.

-   Respond to the client with a CPMCreateQueryOut message.

### 3.1.5.2.3 Receiving a CPMGetQueryStatusIn Request

When the server receives a CPMGetQueryStatusIn message request from a client, the server MUST do the following:

-   Check if the client has query associated with it. If this is not the case, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.
-   Check if the cursor handle is in a list of client's cursor handles. If this is not the case, the server MUST report an E\_FAIL (0x80004005) error.
-   Prepare a CPMGetQueryStatusOut message. The server MUST retrieve the current query status and set it in the \_QStatus field (see 2.2.3.11 for possible values). If this step fails for any reason, the server MUST report an error.
-   Respond to the client with the CPMGetQueryStatusOut message.

### 3.1.5.2.4 Receiving a CPMGetQueryStatusExIn Request

When the server receives a CPMGetQueryStatusExIn message request from a client, the server MUST do the following:

-   Check if the client has a query associated with it. If this is not the case, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.
-   Check if the cursor handle passed is in a list of client's cursor handles. If this is not the case, the server MUST report an E\_FAIL (0x80004005) error.
-   Prepare a CPMGetQueryStatusExOut message. The server MUST retrieve the current query status and query progress and set QStatus (see 2.2.3.11 for possible values), \_dwRatioFinishedDenominator and \_dwRatioFinishedNumerator respectively. It MUST then set the number of rows in the query results to \_cRowsTotal. If this step fails for any reason server MUST report that an error was encountered.
-   Retrieve information about client's catalog and fill in \_cFilteredDocuments and \_cDocumentsToFilter. If this step fails for any reason, the server MUST report that an error was encountered.
-   Retrieve the position of the bookmark indicated by the handle in the \_bmk field, and fill the remaining \_iRowBmk field in the CPMGetQueryStatusExOut message. If this step fails for any reason server MUST report that an error was encountered.
-   Respond to the client with the CPMGetQueryStatusExOut message.

### 3.1.5.2.5 Receiving a CPMRatioFinishedIn Request

When the server receives a CPMRatioFinishedIn message request from a client, the server MUST do the following:

-   Check if the client has query associated with it. If this is not the case, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.
-   Check if the cursor handle passed is in the list of the client's cursor handles. If this is not the case, the server MUST report an E\_FAIL (0x80004005) error.
-   Prepare a CPMRatioFinishedOut message. The server MUST retrieve the client's query status and fill in \_ulNumerator, \_ulDenominator and \_cRows fields. If this step fails for any reason, the server MUST report that an error was encountered.
-   If \_cRows is equal to the last reported number of rows for this query, then set \_fNewRows to 0x00000000, otherwise set it to 0x00000001.
-   Update the last reported number of rows for this query to the value of \_cRows.
-   Respond to the client with the CPMRatioFinishedOut message.

### 3.1.5.2.6 Receiving a CPMSetBindingsIn Request

When the server receives a CPMSetBindingsIn message request from a client, the server MUST do the following:

-   Check if the client has a query associated with it. If this is not the case, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.
-   Check if the cursor handle passed is in the list of the client's cursor handles. If this is not the case, the server MUST report an E\_FAIL (0x80004005) error.
-   Verify that bindings information is valid (i.e., column at least specifies value, length or status to be returned; no overlap in bindings for value, length or status; and value, length and status fit in the row size specified) and if not report a DB\_E\_BADBINDINFO (0x80040E08) error.
-   Save the binding information associated with the columns specified in the aColumns field. If this step fails for any reason, the server MUST report that an error was encountered.
-   Respond to the client with a message header (only) with \_msg set to CPMSetBindingsIn, and \_status set to the results of the specified binding.

### 3.1.5.2.7 Receiving a CPMGetRowsIn Request

When the server receives a CPMGetRowsIn message request from a client, the server MUST do the following:

-   Check if the client has query associated with it. If this is not the case, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.
-   Check if the cursor handle passed is in athelist of the client's cursor handles. If this is not the case, the server MUST report an E\_FAIL (0x80004005) error.
-   Check if the client has a current set of bindings. If this is not the case, the server MUST report an E\_FAIL (0x80004005) error.
-   Prepare a CPMGetRowsOut message. The server MUST position the cursor in query results as indicated by the seek description. If this step fails for any reason, the server MUST report that an error was encountered.
-   Fetch as many rows as fits in a buffer, the size of which is indicated by \_cbReadBuffer, but not more than indicated by \_cRowsToTransfer. When fetching rows, the server MUST compare each selected column's property value type to the type specified in the Client's current set of bindings (section 3.1.1). If the type in the binding is not VT\_VARIANT, the server MUST attempt to convert the column's property value to that type. Otherwise, if the DBPROP\_USEEXTENDEDDBTYPES flag is set in the client's DBPROPSET\_QUERYEXT property set, or if the column's property value is not a VT\_VECTOR type, then the property value MUST be returned in its normal type. If none of these are the case (i.e., the server has a VT\_VECTOR type, and the client does not support VT\_VECTOR), then the server MUST attempt to convert it to a VT\_ARRAY type as follows: VT\_I8, VT\_UI8, VT\_FILETIME, and VT\_CLSID array elements cannot be converted and instead fail; VT\_LPSTR and VT\_LPWSTR array elements MUST be converted to VT\_BSTR; array elements of all other types MUST remain unchanged. Finally, if row columns contain chapter handles or bookmark handles, the server MUST update the corresponding lists. If this step fails for any reason, the server MUST report that an error was encountered.
-   Store the actual number of rows fetched in \_cRowsReturned.
-   Copy the seek description and chapter field from CPMGetRowsIn to a CPMGetRowsOut message to be sent.
-   Store fetched rows in the Rows field (see note on status byte below and section 2.2.3.16 on the structure of the Rows field).
-   Respond to the client with the CPMGetRowsOut message.

Note on status byte field:

If StatusUsed is set to 0x01 in the CTableColumn of the CPMSetBindingIn message for the column, then the server MUST set the status byte (which is located at StatusOffset from the start of the row) for this column to one of the following values:



| Value | Meaning        |
|-------|----------------|
| 0x00  | StatusOK       |
| 0x01  | StatusDeferred |
| 0x02  | StatusNull     |



 

If the property value is absent for this row, the server MUST set the status byte to StatusNull. If the value is too big to be transferred in the CPMGetRowsOut message, the server MUST set the status byte to StatusDeferred. Otherwise the server MUST set the status byte to StatusOK.

### 3.1.5.2.8 Receiving a CPMFetchValueIn Request

When the server receives a CPMFetchValueIn message request from a client, the server MUST do the following:

-   Check if the client has query associated with it. If this is not the case, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.
-   Prepare a CPMFetchValueOut message. If this step fails for any reason, the server MUST report an error.
-   Find the document indicated by the\_wid field and check if the property ID for this document (later referred to as 'property value') indicated by the PropSpec structure is available for this client. If this value is not available the server MUST set \_fValueExists to 0x00000000, and otherwise set \_fValueExists to 0x00000001. If this step fails for any reason, the server MUST report an error.
-   If \_fValueExists is equal to 0x00000001 the server MUST do the following:
-   -   Serialize the property value to a SERIALIZEDPROPERTYVALUE structure and copy, starting from the \_cbSoFar offset, at most \_cbChunk bytes (but not past the end of the serialized property) to vValue field. If this step fails for any reason server MUST report an error.
    -   Set \_cbValue to the number of bytes copied in previous step.
    -   Set vType to the property type of the property value.
    -   If the length of serialized property is greater than \_cbSoFar added to \_cbValue, then set \_fMoreExists to 0x00000001, otherwise set it to 0x00000000.

-   Respond to the client with the CPMFetchValueOut message

### 3.1.5.2.9 Receiving a CPMGetNotify Request

When the server receives a CPMGetNotify message from a client, the server MUST do the following:

-   Check if the client has query associated with it. If this is not the case, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.
-   If there were no changes in the query result set since the last CPMSendNotifyOut message for this client, or if the query is not currently monitored for changes in the results set, then the server MUST respond with CPMGetNotify message and start to monitor the query for changes in results set. If at a later time there is a change in the query results set then the server MUST send exactly one CPMSendNotifyOut message to the client and MUST specify the change in the \_watchNotify field.
-   If there were changes to the query result set since the last CPMSendNotifyOut message, the server MUST reply with CPMSendNotifyOut and MUST specify the change in the \_watchNotify field. Note, that in the case of many changes to query results, DBWATCHNOTIFY\_ROWSCHANGED takes priority (i.e., if the query was done, re-executed and then the number of rows changed and the query was done again then the event reported would be DBWATCHNOTIFY\_ROWSCHANGED).

### 3.1.5.2.10 Receiving a CPMGetApproximatePositionIn Request

When the server receives a CPMGetApproximatePositionIn message request from the client, the server MUST do the following:

-   Check if the client has a query associated with it. If this is not the case, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.
-   Check if the cursor handle, chapter handle and bookmark handle passed are in corresponding lists. If this is not the case, the server MUST report an E\_FAIL (0x80004005) error.
-   Find a row which is associated with the bookmark handle in the query results and approximate the position of the row in the rowset, referred to by the chapter handle, and determine the numerator and denominator for the position. Note that when the chapter handle is DB\_NULL\_HCHAPTER, the corresponding chapter is the main rowset of the query. If this step fails for any reason, the server MUST report an error.
-   Respond to the client with a CPMFetchValueOut message.

### 3.1.5.2.11 Receiving a CPMCompareBmkIn Request

When the server receives a CPMCompareBmkIn message request from the client, the server MUST do the following:

-   Check if the client has a query associated with it. If this is not the case, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.
-   Check if the cursor handle, chapter handle and bookmark handles passed are in corresponding lists. If this is not the case, the server MUST report an E\_FAIL (0x80004005) error.
-   Prepare a CPMCompareBmkOut message.
-   If bookmark handles are equal, then \_dwComparison MUST be is set to DBCOMPARE\_EQ.
-   Otherwise, if one of bookmarks handles is DBBMK\_FIRST or DBBMK\_LAST then \_dwComparison MUST be set to DBCOMPARE\_NE.
-   Otherwise the server MUST do the following:
-   -   Find rows which are referred to by each bookmark handle in the query results
    -   If any one of the rows is not in the chapter indicated by the chapter handle in CPMCompareBmkIn, then \_dwComparison MUST be set to DBCOMPARE\_NOTCOMPARABLE.
    -   Otherwise, when both rows are in the same chapter, then the server MUST approximate a position of those rows in the rowset referred to by this chapter's handle. It MUST then compare position values and set\_dwComparison to DBCOMPARE\_LT if position of first row is smaller than position of the second row; otherwise \_dwComparison MUST be set to DBCOMPARE\_GT.

-   Respond to the client with filled CPMCompareBmkOut message.

### 3.1.5.2.12 Receiving a CPMRestartPositionIn Request

When the server receives the CPMRestartPositionIn message request from the client, the server MUST do the following:

-   Check if the client has a query associated with it. If this is not the case, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.
-   Check if the cursor handle and chapter handle passed are in corresponding lists. If this is not the case, the server MUST report an E\_FAIL (0x80004005) error.
-   Move the cursor to the beginning of the chapter, identified by the chapter handle. Note that when the chapter handle is DB\_NULL\_HCHAPTER, the corresponding chapter is the main rowset of the query. If this step fails for any reason, the server MUST report an error.
-   Respond to the client with a CPMRestartPositionIn message.

### 3.1.5.2.13 Receiving a CPMFreeCursorIn Request

When the server receives a CPMFreeCursorIn message request from the client, the server MUST do the following:

-   Check if the client has a query associated with it. If this is not the case, the server MUST report a STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER (0xC000000D) error.
-   Check if the cursor handle passed is in the list of the client's cursor handles. If this is not the case, the server MUST report an E\_FAIL (0x80004005) error.
-   Release the cursor and associated resources (see section 3.1.1 for complete list) for this cursor handle.
-   Remove the cursor from the list of cursors for that client.
-   Respond with a CPMFreeCursorOut message, setting the \_cCursorsRemaining field with the number of cursors remaining. in this client's list.
-   If there are no more cursors for this client, the server MUST release the query and associated resources (see section 3.1.1).

### 3.1.5.2.14 Receiving a CPMDisconnect Request

When the server receives a CPMDisconnect message request from the client, the server MUST remove the client from the list of connected clients and release all resources associated with the client.

### 3.1.6 Timer Events

None.

### 3.1.7 Other Local Events

When the server is stopped, it MUST first transition to the "shutting down" state. It MUST then stop listening to the pipe, perform any other implementation-specific shutdown tasks, and then transition into the "stopped" state.

### 3.2 Client Details

### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

The following section specifies data and state maintained by the Content Indexing Service Protocol client. The provided data is to facilitate the explanation of how the protocol behaves. This section does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this document.

A client has the following abstract state:

-   **Last Message Sent**: A copy of the last message sent to the server.
-   **Current Property Value**: A partial value of a "deferred" property, which is in the process of being retrieved.
-   **Current Bytes Received**: The number of bytes received for Current Property Value so far.
-   **Named pipe connection state**: A connection to the server

### 3.2.2 Timers

No protocol timers are required.

### 3.2.3 Initialization

No actions are taken until a higher layer request is received.

### 3.2.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

When a request is received from a higher layer, the client MUST create a named pipe connection to the server, using the details specified in Section 2.1. If it is unable to do so, the higher layer request MUST be failed. That is, in case of a failure to connect, it is the responsibility of the higher level to retry if desired.

A header MUST be pre-pended with fields set as specified in section 2.2.2.

For messages that are specified as requiring a nonzero checksum, the \_ulChecksum value MUST be calculated as follows:

1.  The contents of the message after the \_ulReserved2 field in the message header MUST be interpreted as a sequence of 32 bit integers. The client MUST calculate the sum of the numeric values given by these integers.
2.  Calculate the bitwise XOR of this value with 0x59533959.
3.  Subtract the value given by \_msg from the value that results from the bitwise XOR.

### 3.2.4.1 Remote Indexing Service Catalog Management

Each message is triggered by a request from the higher layer. There is no message sequence enforced by the client for CISP message requests for remotely managing catalogs, but (with the exception of a CPMSetCatStateIn message) the server will only reply with success if the client previously connected by means of a CPMConnectIn message.

### 3.2.4.1.1 Sending a CPMCiStateInOut Request

Typically, the higher layer asks the protocol client to send a CPMCiStateInOut message when it requires information about indexing services on the server.

When requested to send this message, the client MUST do the following:

-   Send a CPMCiStateInOut message as specified in section 2.2.3.1 to the server.
-   Wait to receive CPMCiStateInOut message from the server, silently discarding all other messages.
-   Report the value of the \_status field of the response and, if it was successful, the informational structure back to the higher layer.

### 3.2.4.1.2 Sending a CPMSetCatStateIn Request

Typically, the higher layer asks the protocol client to send a CPMSetCatStateIn message when it requires information about a catalog or all catalog. For this message the higher layer needs to provide the protocol client with a value for \_dwNewState and, if required, the name of the catalog.

When requested to send this message, the client MUST do the following:

-   Send a CPMSetCatStateIn message as specified in 2.2.3.2 to the server.
-   Wait to receive a CPMSetCatStateOut message from the server, silently discarding all other messages.
-   Report the value of the \_status field of the response and, if it was successful, the \_dwOldState back to the higher layer.

### 3.2.4.1.3 Sending a CPMUpdateDocumentsIn Request

The higher layer typically asks to send this message when it needs to either update documents in existing path or add a new file path to the index. Thus the higher layer is to provide the path and type of a scan, which is specified as in section 2.2.3.4 where an incremental or full update is meant for existing paths, and new initialization is meant for new paths.

In order to serve the higher layer request, the client MUST do the following:

-   Send a CPMUpdateDocumentsIn message as specified in section 2.2.3.4 to the server.
-   Wait to receive CPMUpdateDocumentsIn message back from the server, silently discarding all other messages.
-   Report the value of the \_status field of the response back to the higher layer.

### 3.2.4.1.4 Sending a CPMForceMergeIn Request

Typically, the higher layer requests to send this message when there is a need to improve query performance, or it's a part of scheduled indexing service maintenance.

In order to serve the higher layer the client MUST do the following:

-   Send CPMForceMergeIn message as specified by section 2.2.3.5 to the server.
-   Wait to receive a CPMUpdateDocumentsIn message back from the server, silently discarding all other messages.
-   Report the value of the \_status field of the response back to the higher layer.

### 3.2.4.2 Remote Indexing Service Catalog Query Messages

With the exception of CPMGetRowsIn/CPMGetRowsOut, CPMFetchValueIn/CPMFetchValueOut, there is a one-to-one relationship between CISP messages and higher layer requests. For the two exceptions mentioned above, there can be multiple messages generated by the client to either satisfy size requirements, or to retrieve a complete property. The higher layer typically keeps track of all query-specific information (such as cursor handles opened, legal values for bookmark and chapter handles, wid values for deferred property values, etc.) and also tracks if the client is in a connected state, but this is not enforced in any way by the client.

For illustrative purposes the client portion of the diagram in Section 3 illustrates this sequence for a simple Indexing Service query.

### 3.2.4.2.1 Sending a CPMConnectIn Request

This message is typically the very first request from the higher layer (as if the client is not connected, the server will fail most of the messages with exception of CPMSetCatStateIn). The higher level provides the protocol client with information necessary to connect.

In order to serve the higher layer, the client MUST do the following:

-   Fill in the message, using information which the higher layer client provided (see section 2.2.3.6) in \_iClientVersion, MachineName, UserName, PropertySet1, PropertySet2 and aPropertySet.
-   Set \_fClientIsRemote, \_cbBlob, \_cbBlob2, cPropSet and cExtPropSet as specified in 2.2.3.6.
-   Set the checksum in the \_ulChecksum field.
-   Send the CPMConnectIn message to the server.
-   Wait to receive a CPMConnectOut message back from the server, silently discarding all other messages.
-   Report the value of the \_status field of the response and, if it was successful, the \_serverVersion back to the higher layer.

For informative purposes, it is expected that higher layers will typically do the following actions upon successful connection, but these are not enforced by the CISP client:

-   Use remote indexing service catalog management messages for administrative tasks
-   Use a CPMCreateQueryIn request to create a search query with a purpose of retrieving results from the catalog.

### 3.2.4.2.2 Sending a CPMCreateQueryIn Request

The higher layer will typically provide information for the query creation once the protocol client is connected. The higher layer provides the client with a restrictions set, columns set, sort order rules and categorization set (each of them can be omitted), rowset properties and property ID mapper structure.

When this request is received from a higher layer, the client MUST do the following:

-   Prepare a CPMCreateQueryOut as follows.
-   -   If a columns set is present then set CColumnsSetPreset to 0x01 and fill the ColumnsSet field.
    -   If restrictions are present, set CRestrictionPresent to 0x01 and fill the Restriction field.
    -   If a sort set is present, fill the SortSet field.
    -   If a categorization set is present, set CSortSetPresent to 0x01 and fill the CategorizationSet field.
    -   Set the rest of fields as specified in 2.2.3.8

-   Calculate \_ulCheckSum field in the header.
-   Send the CPMCreateQueryIn message to the server.
-   Wait to receive CPMCreateQueryOut message (see details in section 3.2.5.1.1), silently discarding all other messages.
-   Report the value of the \_status field of the response and, if it was successful, the array of cursor handles, and informative Boolean values (as specified in 2.2.3.9) back to the higher layer.

### 3.2.4.2.3 Sending a CPMSetBindingsIn Request

Typically, the higher layer will set bindings for each column to be returned in the rows when it already has valid cursor handle (after successfully receiving CPMCreateQueryOut, see section 3.2.5.1.1). The higher is expected to provide an array of CTableColumn structures, as specified in Section 2.2.4.31, for the aColumns field and a valid cursor handle.

When this request is received from the higher layer, the client MUST do the following:

-   Calculate the number of CTableColumn structures in the aColumns array, and set the cColumns field to this value.
-   Calculate the total size in bytes of the cColumns and aColumns fields, and set the \_cbBindingDesc field to this value.
-   Set specified fields in CPMSetBindingsIn message to the values provided by the higher application layer. Set the \_ulChecksum field to the value calculated as specified in Section 3.2.5.
-   Send the completed CPMSetBindignsIn message to the server.
-   Wait to receive a CPMSetBindingsIn message from server, discarding other messages.
-   Indicate the status from \_status field of the response to the higher layer.

For informative purposes, it is expected that higher layers will typically request a client to send a CPMGetRowsIn message, but this is not enforced by the Content Indexing Service Protocol.

### 3.2.4.2.4 Sending a CPMGetRowsIn Request

When the higher layer is about to receive rows information it will provide protocol client with valid cursor and chapter handle and give appropriate seek description. Typically, a higher layer is expected to do so when it has a valid cursor and/or chapter handle, and the bindings had been set with CPMSetBindingsIn message. To access the rowset in a chapter, the higher layer is to use chapter handle received from the server in a previous CPMGetRowsOut message.

When this request is received from the higher layer, the client MUST do the following:

-   Determine what unsigned integer value to specify for the \_cbReadBuffer field. To determine this value, the client MUST take the maximum value from the following:
-   -   One thousand times the value of the c\_RowsToTransfer field.
    -   Value of \_cbRowWidth, rounded up to the nearest 512 byte multiple.
    -   Take the higher of these two values, up to the 16K limit.
    -   In cases where a single row is larger than 16K, the server cannot return results to this query.

Specify a client base for variable-sized row data in client address space in \_ulClientBase field.

*Windows Behavior: For a 32-bit client talking to a 32-bit server, or a 64 bit client talking to a 64-bit server this value is set to a memory address of the receiving buffer in application process. This allows for pointers, received in Rows field of CPMGetRowsOut to be correct memory pointers in a client application process. Otherwise it is set to 0x00000000.*

-   Calculate the size of seek description and set it in the \_cbSeek field.
-   Set the value of cbReserved (which would act as an offset for Rows start) to the value of \_cbSeek plus 0x14.
-   Send a CPMConnectIn message as specified in 2.2.3.15 to the server.

### 3.2.4.2.5 Sending a CPMFetchValueIn Request

If the client receives a CPMGetRowsOut response from the server with the column's Status field set to StatusDeferred (0x01) it means that the property value was not included in the Rows field of the CPMGetRowsOut message. In this case the higher layer typically asks the protocol client to retrieve the value by means of CPMFetchValueIn message, and provides the PropSpec and \_wid value for a deferred property, which the protocol client MUST use in the first CPMFetchValueIn message.

If this is the first CPMFetchValueIn message the client has sent to request the specified property, the client MUST do the following:

-   Set all the fields in a message as specified in section 2.2.3.19.
-   Set \_cbSoFar to 0x00000000.
-   Set Current Bytes Received to 0.
-   Send the CPMFetchValueIn message to the server.

### 3.2.4.2.6 Sending a CPMFreeCursorIn Request

Once the higher level is no longer using the search query, it can release the resources on the server by asking the client to send a CPMFreeCursorIn message.

When this request is received, the client MUST send a CPMFreeCursorIn message as specified in 2.2.3.28 to the server, containing the handle specified by the upper layer.

### 3.2.4.2.7 Sending a CPMDisconnect Message

If the higher layer has no more queries for the indexing service, to free up more server resources, the application may request that the client send a CPMDisconnect message to the server. When this query is received, the client MUST simply send the message as requested. There is no response to this message from the server.

### 3.2.5 Message Processing and Sequencing Rules

When the client receives a message response from the server, the client MUST use the Last Sent Message to determine if the message received from the server is the one expected by the client. All messages with \_msg field different from the one in Last Send Message MUST be ignored.

### 3.2.5.1 Receiving a CPMCreateQueryOut Response

When the client receives a CPMCreateQueryOut message response from the server, the client MUST return \_status and (if the status is successful) cursor handle values back to higher layer. Any further actions are up to the higher layer.

As the higher layer is aware of query structure it will always expect correct number of cursor handles to be returned in the CPMCreateOueryOut message. The cursor handles are returned in the following order: the first handle is to the unchaptered rowset, the second is to the first chaptered rowset (which is the grouping of results based on the first category specified in the CategorizationSet field of the CPMCreateQueryIn message.)

For informative purposes, it is expected that higher layers can do the following actions, but these are not enforced by the CISP client:

-   Use CPMSetBindingsIn, to set bindings for individual columns and do any subsequent actions on query path
-   Use CPMGetQueryStatusIn, to check on the execution progress of a query.
-   Use CPMRatioFinishedIn, to request the completion percentage of the query.

### 3.2.5.2 Receiving a CPMGetRowsOut Response

When the client receives a CPMGetRowsOut message response from the server, the client MUST do the following:

-   Check if the \_status field in the header indicates success or failure.
-   If the \_status value is STATUS\_BUFFER\_TOO\_SMALL (0xC0000023), the client MUST check the Last Message Sent state. If it does not contain a CPMGetRowsIn message, the received message MUST be silently ignored. Otherwise, the client MUST send to the server a new CPMGetRowsIn message with all fields identical to the stored one, except that the \_cbReadBuffer MUST be increased by 512 (but not greater than 0x4000). If \_status is STATUS\_BUFFER\_TOO\_SMALL (0xC0000023), and Last Message Sent already has \_cbReadBuffer equal to 0x4000 client MUST report the error up to the higher level.
-   If the \_status value is any other error value, the client MUST indicate the failure up to the higher layer.
-   If the \_status value indicates success, the results MUST be indicated up to the higher layer requesting the information, and further actions are up to the higher layer.

For informative purposes, it is expected that higher layers will typically do the following actions, but these are not enforced by the Content Indexing Service Protocol client:

-   If the values in rows represent the document IDs, chapter or bookmark handles the higher layer will typically store them for use in subsequent operations which involve valid document IDs, chapter or bookmark handles.
-   The higher layer will typically store or display or otherwise use the data from row values.
-   For the values which were marked as deferred higher layer will fetch the value using CPMFetchValueIn messages.
-   The seek description is returned back to higher layer as well, and can be reused or examined by the higher layer.

For informative purposes, if the higher layer requested handles to chapters and bookmarks which were received in the rows, it may do the following:

-   Use CPMGetQueryStatusExIn, to check on the execution progress of a query, as well as additional status information, such as the number of filtered documents, documents remaining to be filtered, the ratio of documents processed by the query, the total number of rows in the query, and the position of the bookmark in the rowset.
-   Use CPMGetNotify, to request that the server notify the client of rowset changes.
-   Use CPMGetApproximatePositionIn, to request the approximate position of a bookmark in a chapter.
-   Use CPMCompareBmkIn, to request a comparison of two bookmarks in a chapter.
-   Use CPMRestartPositionIn, to the server to change the location of the cursor to the start of rowset.

### 3.2.5.3 Receiving a CPMFetchValueOut Response

When the client receives a CPMGetRowsOut message response from the server, the client MUST do the following:

-   Check if the \_status field in the header indicates success or failure. In a case of failure notify the higher layer. Otherwise, continue below.
-   Check \_fValueExist, and if set to 0x00000000 notify the higher layer that the value was not found.
-   Otherwise append \_ cbValue bytes from vValue to Current Property Value.
-   If \_\_fMoreExists is set to 0x00000001 then increment \_Current Bytes Received by \_cbValue and send a CPMFetchValueIn message to the server, setting \_cbSoFar to the value of Current Bytes Received, \_cbPropSpec to zero and \_cbChunk to the buffer size desired by the higher layer.
-   If \_fMoreExists is set to 0x00000000 then indicate the property value from Current Property Value to the higher layer.

### 3.2.5.4 Receiving a CPMFreeCursorOut Response

When the client receives a successful CPMFreeCursorOut message response from the server, the client MUST return the \_cCursorsRemaining value to the higher layer.

The following information is given for informative purposes only and is not enforced by the CISP client. The higher layer is expected to keep track of cursor handles and not to use ones which have already been freed. Once the number of \_cCursorsRemaining is equal to 0x00000000, the higher layer can use the connection to specify another query (using a CPMCreateQueryIn message).

        -   **CiTblChapt** is set to 0x00000000.
        -   **\_hRegion** is set to 0x00000000.
        -   **\_cSkip** is set to 0 indicating that the client does not want to skip rows.
    -   **Rows** contains the size of the 100 documents that contain the word "Microsoft". Since this is fixed-sized data, it is simply structured as a list of 100, 8-byte unsigned integers.

11. The client sends a CPMDisconnect message to end the connection.

    The header of the message is populated as follows:

    -   **\_msg** is set to 0x000000C9, indicating that this is a CPMDisconnect message.
    -   **\_status** is set to 0x00000000.
    -   **\_ulChecksum** is set to 0x00000000.

12. The server processes the message and removes all client state.

### 4.2 Example 2

In the previous example, the query was quite simple. Let us now consider a slightly more complex query. Let us assume that the user wants to retrieve the size of the documents that contain both the following words: "Microsoft" and "Office". This is specified by changing the Restriction field contained in the CPMCreateQueryIn message sent in step 5 as follows:

The **Restriction** field is of type CRestriction and is set to:

-   -   **\_ulType** is set to 0x00000004 (RTAnd).
    -   **\_weight** is set to 0x00000000.

The rest of the field contains a CNodeRestriction structure:

-   -   **\_cNode** is set to 0x00000002, indicating that there are two nodes in the paNode array.
    -   The **\_paNode** field is an array of two CRestriction structures.

        **\_paNode\[0\]** contains:

        -   -   **\_ulType** is set to 0x00000004 (RTContent).
            -   **\_weight** is set to 0x00000000.
            -   The rest of the field contains a CContentRestriction structure:
                -   **\_Property** is set to GUID b725f130-47ef-101a-a5f1-02608c9eebac / 0x00000001 (for PRSPEC\_PROPID) / 0x13.
                -   **\_Cc** is set to 0x00000009.
                -   **\_pwcsphrase** is set to the string "Microsoft".
                -   **\_lcid** is set to 0x409 (for English).
                -   **\_ulGenerateMethod** is set to 0x00000000 (exact match).

        **\_paNode\[1\]** contains:

        -   -   **\_ulType** is set to 0x00000004 (RTContent).
            -   **\_weight** is set to 0x00000000.
            -   The rest of the field contains a CContentRestriction structure:
                -   **\_Property** is set to GUID b725f130-47ef-101a-a5f1-02608c9eebac / 0x00000001 (for PRSPEC\_PROPID) / 0x13.
                -   **\_Cc** is set to 0x00000006.
                -   **\_pwcsphrase** is set to the string "Office".
                -   **\_lcid** is set to 0x409 (for English).
                -   **\_ulGenerateMethod** is set to 0x00000000 (exact match).

### 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

Indexing implementations which index secure content should consider using the user context provided by SMB \[MS-SMB\] to trim search results and return only those accessible to the caller.
