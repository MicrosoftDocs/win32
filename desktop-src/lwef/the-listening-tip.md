# The Listening Tip

\[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.\]

The Listening Tip is another speech input service provided by Microsoft Agent. When speech input is installed, Agent includes a special tooltip window that appears when the user presses the Listening hotkey or calls the Listen method. The Listening Tip appears only when the speech services are available. If no client has authored a voice command or successfully loads a speech engine, the Listening Tip does not appear. Further, both speech input and the Display Listening Tips option in the Advanced Character Options must be enabled for the tip to appear.

The following table summarizes the display of the Listening Tip when speech recognition is enabled.

The Listening Tip automatically times out after being presented. If the "Heard" text time-out completes while the user is still holding down the hotkey, the tip reverts to the "listening" text unless the server receives another matching utterance. In this case, the tip displays the new "Heard" text and begins the time-out for that tip text. If the user releases the hotkey and the server is displaying the "Heard" text, the time-out continues and the Listening Tip window is hidden when the time-out interval elapses.

If the server has not yet attempted to load a speech recognition engine, the Listening Tip will not display. Similarly, if the user has disabled the display of the Listening Tip or disabled speech input in Advanced Character Options, the Listening Tip will not be displayed.

The Listening Tip does not appear when the pointer is over the character's taskbar icon. Instead, the standard notification tip window appears and displays the character's name.

Client applications cannot write directly to the Listening Tip, but you can specify alternative text that the server displays on recognition of a matching voice command. To do this, set the [**Confidence**](confidence-property.md) property and the new [**ConfidenceText**](confidencetext-property.md)property for the command. If spoken input matches the command, but the best match does not exceed the confidence setting, the server uses the text set in the **ConfidenceText** property in the tip window. If the client does not supply this value, the server displays the text (grammar) it matched.

The Listening Tip text appears in the language based on the input-active client's character language ID setting, regardless of whether there is a language-compatible speech recognition engine available.
