# Selecting a Device (WPD API)

After your application enumerates the connected devices, you may want to give the user the ability to select a particular device and establish a connection for further operations. In the sample application, the `ChooseDevice` function in the DeviceEnumeration.cpp module accomplishes these tasks.

The `ChooseDevice` function uses the device enumeration code that we've already seen to enumerate the available devices. (Refer to the [Enumerating Devices](enumerating-devices.md) section for more information.)
