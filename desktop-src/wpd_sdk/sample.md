# WPD samples

The Windows SDK provides two samples: [WpdApiSample](wpdapisample-sample-application.md) and [WpdServiceApiSample](wpdapisample-sample-service-application.md).

The WpdApiSample is a command-line desktop application that allows the user to perform several functions such as: enumerating connected devices, exploring the objects on these devices, and enumerating object properties.

The WpdServiceApiSample is a command-line desktop application that supports a Contacts device service and allows the user to perform functions such as: enumerating connected device services, retrieving properties and formats for a given service, and invoking methods on that service.
