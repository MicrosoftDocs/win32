# Requirements for Objects

WPD classifies all objects by content type. An object of a specific type is expected to support a minimum list of properties and resources (and, for the device object, a set of commands). An object's type is described by its [WPD\_OBJECT\_CONTENT\_TYPE](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff597893(v=vs.85)) property; every object must support this property.

WPD defines the following content types (as GUID values). A vendor is free to create their own custom-content type by providing their own GUID.

Note General purpose applications will typically only handle one of the predefined types. Vendor applications can, of course, take full advantage of the custom types they know about.

To learn which properties and resources each must support, see the description page for each of the following object types.
