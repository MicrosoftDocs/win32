# Properties and Attributes

Properties describe objects, properties, resources, and devices. Attributes are a special kind of property that describes other properties or resources.

Properties and attributes are defined as **PROPERTYKEY** structures with two parts: a category GUID, and a unique ID for that category. Properties that describe related things share a common GUID; this GUID is their property category. A category can describe one or more properties, each with a unique ID. Microsoft defines a set of property categories; you can use these for your own properties or create new categories yourself.

The topics that follow list the attributes and properties that are defined by Windows Portable Devices.
