# Retrieving Device Information

The WPD API provides a rich set of interfaces and methods that you can use to retrieve information for a given device. In general, device data can be divided into three categories, as described in the following table.



| Device Data                                                                             | Description                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Functional categories](retrieving-the-functional-categories-supported-by-a-device.md) | The functional categories describe the operations that a device is capable of performing. |
| [Content types](retrieving-the-content-types-supported-by-a-device.md)                 | The content types denote which types of content a device is capable of rendering.         |
| [Events](retrieving-the-events-supported-by-a-device.md)                               | Some devices are capable of firing events that your application can track and respond to. |
