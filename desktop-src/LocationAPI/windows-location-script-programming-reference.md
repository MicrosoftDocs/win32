# Location API Object Model Reference

\[The Location API object model is available for use in the operating systems specified in the Requirements section. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, to access location from a website, use the [W3C Geolocation API](/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/samples/gg589513(v=vs.85)). To access location from a desktop application, use the [**Windows.Devices.Geolocation**](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Geolocation) API.\]

The Location API provides objects that you can use in scripting languages, such as Microsoft JScript. You can use these objects to add location functionality to your webpages. These objects are documented in the following sections.

-   [**LocationDisp.DispCivicAddressReport**](locationdisp-dispcivicaddressreport.md)
-   [**LocationDisp.CivicAddressReportFactory**](locationdisp-civicaddressreportfactory.md)
-   [**LocationDisp.DispLatLongReport**](locationdisp-displatlongreport.md)
-   [**LocationDisp.LatLongReportFactory**](locationdisp-latlongreportfactory.md)
-   [LocationDisp Events](locationdisp-events.md)
