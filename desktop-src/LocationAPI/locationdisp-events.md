# LocationDisp Events

\[The Location API object model is available for use in the operating systems specified in the Requirements section. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, to access location from a website, use the [W3C Geolocation API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/gg589513). To access location from a desktop application, use the [**Windows.Devices.Geolocation**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br225603) API.\]

The Location API object model provides the following events.
