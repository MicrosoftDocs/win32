# Location API C++ Programming Reference

\[The Win32 Location API is available for use in the operating systems specified in the Requirements section. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use the [**Windows.Devices.Geolocation**](/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Geolocation) API. \]

This section documents COM interfaces and other C++ constructs for location programming.
