# System Power States

To the user, the system appears to be either on or off. There are no other detectable states. However, the system supports multiple power states that correspond to the power states defined in the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specification. There are also variations of these states, such as hybrid sleep and fast startup. This topic introduces these states and describes how they relate to each other.

> [!NOTE]
> System integrators and developers creating drivers or applications with a system service should be particularly careful of driver quality issues, such as memory leaks. While driver quality has always been important, the up time between kernel reboots may be significantly longer than on previous versions of the OS because on user initiated sleeps and shutdowns, the kernel, drivers, and services will be preserved and restored, not re-started.

 

The following table lists the ACPI power states from highest to lowest power consumption.

The [**SYSTEM\_POWER\_STATE**](/windows/desktop/api/WinNT/ne-winnt-system_power_state) enumeration defines values that are used to specify system power states.

## Working state (S0)

During the working state, the system is awake and running. In simple terms, the device is "on." Whether the screen is on or off, the device is in a full running state. To conserve energy, especially on battery powered devices, we highly recommend powering-down hardware components when they're not being used.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Power-down hardware components whenever they're not being used - regardless of the state. Low power consumption is an important consideration for mobile device consumers.

 

## Sleep state (Modern Standby)

In the S0 low-power idle mode of the working state, also referred to as [Modern Standby](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=624142), the system remains partially running. During Modern Standby, the system can stay up-to-date whenever a suitable network is available and also wake when real-time action is required, such as OS maintenance. Modern Standby wakes significantly faster than S1-S3. For more info, see [Modern Standby](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=624142).

> [!Note]  
> Modern Standby is only available on some SoC systems. When it's supported, the system does not support S1-S3.

 

## Sleep state (S1-S3)

The system enters sleep based on a number of criteria, including user or application activity and preferences that the user sets on the **Power & sleep** page of the **Settings** app. By default, the system uses the lowest-powered sleep state supported by all enabled wake-up devices. For more information about how the system determines when to enter sleep, see [System Sleep Criteria](system-sleep-criteria.md).

Before the system enters sleep, it determines the appropriate sleep state, notifies applications and drivers of the pending transition, and then transitions the system to the sleep state. In the case of a critical transition, such as when the critical battery threshold is reached, the system does not notify applications and drivers. Applications need to be prepared for this and take the appropriate action when the system returns to the working state.

In these states (S1-S3), volatile memory is kept refreshed to maintain the system state. Some components remain powered so the computer can wake from input from the keyboard, LAN, or a USB device.

The system also wakes from sleep in response to user activity or a wake-up event defined by an application. For more information, see [System Wake-up Events](system-wake-up-events.md). The amount of time it takes the system to wake depends on the sleep state it is waking from. The system takes more time to wake from a lower-powered state (S3) than from a higher-powered state (S1) because of the extra work the hardware may have to do (stabilize the power supply, reinitialize the processor, and so forth).

> [!Caution]  
> When calling [**SetThreadExecutionState**](/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-setthreadexecutionstate), the **ES\_AWAYMODE\_REQUIRED** value should be used only when absolutely necessary by media applications that require the system to perform background tasks such as recording television content or streaming media to other devices while the system appears to be sleeping. Applications that do not require critical background processing or that run on portable computers should not enable away mode because it prevents the system from conserving power by entering true sleep.

 

### Hybrid sleep (S1-S3 + hibernation file)

*Hybrid sleep* is a special state that's a combination of the sleep and hibernation states, it's when a system uses a hibernation file with S1-S3. It's only available on some systems. When enabled, the system writes a hibernation file but enters a higher-powered sleep state. If power is lost while the system is sleeping, the system wakes from hibernation, which takes longer but restores the user's system state.

## Hibernate state (S4)

Windows uses hibernation to provide a fast startup experience. When available, it's also used on mobile devices to extend the usable battery life of a system by giving a mechanism to save all of the user s state prior to shutting down the system. In a Hibernate transition, all the contents of memory are written to a file on the primary system drive, the *hibernation file*. This preserves the state of the operating system, applications, and devices. In the case where the combined memory footprint consumes all of physical memory, the hibernation file must be large enough to ensure there will be space to save all the contents of physical memory. Since data is written to non-volatile storage, DRAM does not need to maintain self-refresh and can be powered off, which means power consumption of hibernation is very low, almost the same as power off.

During a full shutdown and boot (S5), the entire user session is torn down and restarted on the next boot. In contrast, during a hibernation (S4), the user session is closed and the user state is saved.

### Fast startup (reduced hibernation file)

*Fast startup* is a type of shutdown that uses a hibernation file to speed up the subsequent boot. During this type of shutdown, the user is logged off before the hibernation file is created. Fast startup allows for a smaller hibernation file, more appropriate for systems with less storage capabilities. For more info, see [Hibernation file types](#hibernation-file-types).

When using fast startup, the system appears to the user as though a full shutdown (S5) has occurred, even though the system has actually gone through S4. This includes how the system responds to device wake alarms.

Fast startup logs off user sessions, but the contents of kernel (session 0) are written to hard disk. This enables faster boot.

To programmatically initiate a fast startup-style shutdown, call the [**InitiateShutdown**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winreg/nf-winreg-initiateshutdowna) function with the **SHUTDOWN\_HYBRID** flag or the [**ExitWindowsEx**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-exitwindowsex) function with the **EWX\_HYBRID\_SHUTDOWN** flag.

> [!Note]  
> Starting in Windows 8, fast startup is the default transition when a system shutdown is requested. A full shutdown (S5) occurs when a system restart is requested (or an application calls a shutdown API).

 

### Entering hibernation

When a hibernate request is made, the following steps occur as the system enters hibernation:

1.  Apps and services are notified
2.  Drivers are notified
3.  User and system state is saved to disk in a compressed format
4.  Firmware is notified

> [!Note]  
> Starting in Windows 8, all cores on the system are used to compress the data in memory and write it to disk.

 

To programmatically initiate a hibernate transition, call the [**SetSuspendState**](/windows/desktop/api/PowrProf/nf-powrprof-setsuspendstate) function.

### Resuming from hibernation

When a system resumes from hibernation.

When a system is powered on, the following steps occur as the system resumes from hibernation.

1.  System POST
2.  System memory is decompressed and restored from the hibernation file
3.  Device initialization
4.  Drivers are restored to the state they were in prior to hibernation
5.  Services are restored to the state they were in prior to hibernation
6.  System becomes available for login

A resume from hibernation starts with a system POST that is similar to an S5 shutdown. The OS boot manager determines that a resume from hibernation is required by detecting a valid hibernation file. Then it directs the system to resume, restoring the contents of memory and all architectural registers. In the case of a resume from hibernation, the contents of the system memory are read back in from the disk, decompressed, and restored, putting the system in the exact state it was in when it was hibernated. After memory is restored, the devices are re-started, the machine returns to a running state, ready for login.

> [!Note]  
> During a resume from hibernation, drivers and services are notified, but are not restarted. They are only restored to the state they were in prior to hibernation.

 

### Hibernation file types

Hibernation files are used for hybrid sleep, fast startup, and standard hibernation (described earlier). There are two types, differentiated by size, a full and reduced size hibernation file. Only fast startup can use a reduced hibernation file.



| Hibernation file type | Default size           | Supports...                           |
|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Full                  | 40% of physical memory | hibernate, hybrid sleep, fast startup |
| Reduced               | 20% of physical memory | fast startup                          |



 

To verify or change the type of hibernation file used, run the **powercfg.exe** utility. The following examples demonstrate how. For more information, run `powercfg /? hibernate`.

## Soft Off state (S5)

The soft off state is when the system fully shuts down without a hibernation file. Soft off is also known as a "full shutdown." During a full shutdown and boot, the entire user session is torn down and restarted on the next boot. Consequently, a boot/startup from this state takes significantly longer than S1-S4. A full shutdown (S5) occurs when a system restart is requested (or an application calls a shutdown API).

## Mechanical Off state (G3)

In this state, the system is completely off and consumes no power. The system returns to the working state only after a full reboot.

## Wake-on-LAN behavior

The wake-on-LAN (WOL) feature wakes the computer from a low power state when a network adapter detects a WOL event (typically, a specially constructed Ethernet packet).

WOL is supported from sleep (S3) or hibernate (S4). It is not supported from fast startup or soft off (S5) shutdown states. NICs are not armed for wake in these states because users do not expect their systems to wake up on their own.

> [!Note]  
> WOL is not officially supported from soft off (S5). However, the BIOS on some systems may support arming NICs for wake, even though Windows is not involved in the process.
