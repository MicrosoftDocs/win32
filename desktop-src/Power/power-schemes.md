# Power Schemes

A power scheme is a collection of settings that controls the power usage of your computer. You can use power schemes to reduce the power consumption of individual devices or the entire system. You can configure optional features, such as support for hibernation, the amount of time the system must be idle before turning off the display, or the sleep state used when the system idle timer expires.

There are several ways to create power schemes: the Power Options application in Control Panel, the PowerCfg.exe command line tool, and the power scheme API. For more information about Power Options or PowerCfg.exe, please see the help included with the operating system.

The following topics describe the power scheme support provided by the power scheme API:

-   [Power Policy Settings](power-policy-settings.md)
-   [Power Scheme Management](managing-power-schemes.md)
-   [Administrator Overrides](administrator-overrides.md)
