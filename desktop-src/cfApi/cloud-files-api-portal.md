# Cloud Sync Engines

Also see [Cloud Mirror sample](./build-a-cloud-file-sync-engine.md#cloud-mirror-sample).

Starting in Windows 10, version 1709, Windows provides the *cloud files API*. This API consists of several native Win32 and WinRT APIs that formalize support for cloud sync engines, and handles tasks such as creating and managing placeholder files and directories. Users of this API are typically sync providers and to some extent, Windows applications.
