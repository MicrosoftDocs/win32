# Window Stations and Desktops

Windows provides three main categories of objects: user interface, graphics device interface (GDI), and kernel. [Kernel objects](/windows/desktop/SysInfo/kernel-objects) are securable, while [user objects](/windows/desktop/SysInfo/user-objects) and [GDI objects](/windows/desktop/SysInfo/gdi-objects) are not. Therefore, to provide additional security, user interface objects are managed using window stations and desktops, which themselves are securable objects.
