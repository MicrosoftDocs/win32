# Thread Connection to a Desktop

After a process connects to a window station, the system assigns a desktop to the thread making the connection. The system determines the desktop to assign to the thread according to the following rules:

1.  If the thread has called the [**SetThreadDesktop**](/windows/win32/Winuser/nf-winuser-setthreaddesktop?branch=master) function, it connects to the specified desktop.
2.  If the thread did not call [**SetThreadDesktop**](/windows/win32/Winuser/nf-winuser-setthreaddesktop?branch=master), it connects to the desktop inherited from the parent process.
3.  If the thread did not call [**SetThreadDesktop**](/windows/win32/Winuser/nf-winuser-setthreaddesktop?branch=master) and did not inherit a desktop, the system attempts to open for MAXIMUM\_ALLOWED access and connect to a desktop as follows:
    -   If a desktop name was specified in the **lpDesktop** member of the [**STARTUPINFO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms686331) structure that was used when the process was created, the thread connects to the specified desktop.
    -   Otherwise, the thread connects to the default desktop of the window station to which the process connected.

The desktop assigned during this connection process cannot be closed by calling the [**CloseDesktop**](/windows/win32/Winuser/nf-winuser-closedesktop?branch=master) function.

When a process is connecting to a desktop, the system searches the process's handle table for inherited handles. The system uses the first desktop handle it finds. If you want a child process to connect to a particular inherited desktop, you must ensure that the only the desired handle is marked inheritable. If a child process inherits multiple desktop handles, the results of the desktop connection are undefined.

Handles to a desktop that the system opens while connecting a process to a desktop are not inheritable.
