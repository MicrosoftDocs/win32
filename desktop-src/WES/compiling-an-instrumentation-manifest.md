# Compiling an Instrumentation Manifest

After [writing your manifest](writing-an-instrumentation-manifest.md), use the message compiler to validate the manifest and generate the resource and header files that you include in your provider. For details on using the compiler, see [**Message Compiler**](message-compiler--mc-exe-.md). Include the header and resource files that the compiler generates in the project that contains the rest of your provider's source code. For information on how to write the events that are defined in your manifest, see [Developing a Provider](developing-a-provider.md).
