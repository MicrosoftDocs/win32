## Attributes



| Name    | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| default | boolean   | Determines if this output type should be used as the default output type for the parent input type. Set to **true** to use this output type as the default type; otherwise, **false**.<br/> |
| xmlType | **QName** | The name of the output type.<br/>                                                                                                                                                           |



## Remarks

The following lists the recognized output types that you can specify in your manifest. The output type determines how the service renders the data. The output types are defined in the \\Include\\Winmeta.xml file, which is included in the Windows SDK.

**Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista:** The service does not use the output type to render the data; instead the service uses the input type to determine how to render the data.

| xs:string                      | Text data. This type is valid for the UnicodeString and AnsiString input types. Starting with the mc.exe shipped with the Windows Server 2016 SDK or later (mc.exe version 10.0.14251 or later), this type is also valid for the Int8, UInt8, and UInt16 input types, in which case it the data is interpreted as a single character.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| xs:datetime                    | An XML date/time. This is the default format for all dates. The date is formatted using the cultural markers embedded in the string (for example, Left-to-Right or Right-to-Left). For information on formatting dates and times, see Retrieving Time and Date Information on MSDN. This type is valid for the FILETIME and SYSTEMTIME input types. **Prior to the version of the MC compiler that ships with the Windows 7 version of the Windows SDK:** The date is not rendered using the cultural markers embedded in the string (for example, Left-to-Right or Right-to-Left).<br/>                                                  |
