# \_\_SecurityRelatedClass class

The **\_\_SecurityRelatedClass** abstract system class serves as a parent class for all types of security classes. No instances of this class are ever created, and all security classes must derive from this base class.

The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties. Properties are listed in alphabetic order, not MOF order.

## Syntax

``` syntax
[abstract]
class __SecurityRelatedClass
{
};
```

## Members

The **\_\_SecurityRelatedClass** class does not define any members.
