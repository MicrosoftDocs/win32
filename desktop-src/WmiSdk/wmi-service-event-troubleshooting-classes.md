# WMI Service Event Troubleshooting Classes

WMI service event troubleshooting classes are generated by events within the WMI service, such as thread pool creation.

You can subscribe to the abstract base class [**MSFT\_WmiEssEvent**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wmisystemprov/msft-wmiessevent) notifications to obtain all of the derived events listed in the following table.
