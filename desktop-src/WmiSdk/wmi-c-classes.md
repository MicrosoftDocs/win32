# WMI Provider Framework C++ Classes

\[WMI C++ classes that are part of the WMI Provider Framework are now considered in final state, and no further development, enhancements, or updates will be available for non-security related issues affecting these libraries. The [MI APIs](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wmi_v2/windows-management-infrastructure) should be used for all new development.\]
