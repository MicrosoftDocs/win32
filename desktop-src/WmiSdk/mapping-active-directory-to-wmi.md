# Mapping Active Directory to WMI

The Directory Services Provider mirrors classes and instances from Active Directory into the WMI Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) namespace. Because of fundamental differences in the two environments, you cannot simply rename the Active Directory classes and instances and hope to properly access those classes and instances in WMI. Instead, the Directory Services provider follows naming rules to preserve the relationships that exist between the Active Directory classes and instances.

The following topics provide information about mapping Active Directory classes and instances:

-   [Mapping Active Directory Classes](mapping-active-directory-classes.md)
-   [Mapping Active Directory Instances](mapping-active-directory-instances.md)

> [!Note]  
> For more information about support and installation of this component on a specific operating system, see [Operating System Availability of WMI Components](operating-system-availability-of-wmi-components.md).
