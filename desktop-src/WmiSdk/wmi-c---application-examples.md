# WMI C++ Application Examples

The WMI application examples in this section are written in C++. They demonstrate a range of tasks that can be completed using WMI components and offer an alternative over using Visual Basic scripts. Each application is separated into a series of steps in a similar way so that code sections from different examples can easily be combined to form customized applications.

The following table lists the C++ examples in this section.



| Example                                                                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Example: Getting WMI Data from the Local Computer](example--getting-wmi-data-from-the-local-computer.md)                               | This example connects to the WMI namespace on the local computer and gets data from a query on the local computer. The data is gathered semisynchronously. |
| [Example: Getting WMI Data from the Local Computer Asynchronously](example--getting-wmi-data-from-the-local-computer-asynchronously.md) | This example connects to the WMI namespace on the local computer and gets data from a query on the local computer. The data is gathered asynchronously.    |
| [Example: Getting WMI Data from a Remote Computer](example--getting-wmi-data-from-a-remote-computer.md)                                 | This example connects to the WMI namespace on a remote computer and gets data from a query on the remote computer. The data is gathered semisynchronously. |
| [Example: Calling a Provider Method](example--calling-a-provider-method.md)                                                             | This example connects to the WMI namespace on the local computer and calls a method in WMI. The method is executed synchronously.                          |
| [Example: Receiving Event Notifications Through WMI](example--receiving-event-notifications-through-wmi-.md)                            | This example connects to the WMI namespace on the local computer and receives an event from the local computer. The event is received semisynchronously.   |
