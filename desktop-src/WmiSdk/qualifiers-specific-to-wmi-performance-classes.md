# Qualifiers Specific to WMI Performance Classes

Raw performance counter classes, derived from [**Win32\_PerfRawData**](/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32-perfrawdata), contain uncalculated values that serve as input for [**Win32\_PerfFormattedData**](/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32-perfformatteddata) classes, as well as System Monitor calculations.

Performance counter qualifiers specify information about the performance object and the counters for that object. Performance objects map to WMI [performance counter classes](/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/performance-counter-classes) and performance counters are represented by the properties of the WMI class.
