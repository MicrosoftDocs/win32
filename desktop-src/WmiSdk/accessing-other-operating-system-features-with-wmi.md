# Accessing Other Operating System Features with WMI

WMI has extensions or providers that enable you to access other operating system features, such as Active Directory, ODBC, and SNMP. You can also access data from device drivers.

The WMI extensions are not available in all operating systems. For more information, see [Operating System Availability of WMI Components](operating-system-availability-of-wmi-components.md).

The following topics provide information about accessing other operating system features:

-   [Accessing Active Directory](accessing-active-directory.md)
-   [Accessing SNMP Devices](accessing-snmp-devices.md)
