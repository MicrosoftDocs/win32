# COOKER\_AVERAGE

The COOKER\_AVERAGE counter type formula provides the statistical midpoint of the data for a counter. The formula for this counter type sums repeated observations of one property in a [**Win32\_PerfRawData**](/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32-perfrawdata) instance, and divides the sum by the number of observations. This counter type is defined only within WMI, and it is not available to the performance monitoring technologies, such as [Performance Counters Version 6.0](/windows/desktop/PerfCtrs/performance-counters-portal).

For more information about the counter type formula, see [Counter Types](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc785636(v=ws.10)).

For more information about WMI high-performance providers and scripting, see [WMI Performance Counter Types](wmi-performance-counter-types.md).
