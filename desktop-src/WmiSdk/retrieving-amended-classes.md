# Retrieving Amended Classes

You can retrieve and modify an amended class by specifying a locale and setting a flag that indicates that you want localized information. The procedure used to retrieve localized class definitions depends on how you connect to WMI. For more information, see [Retrieving Amended Classes Using the Scripting API for WMI](retrieving-amended-classes-using-the-scripting-api-for-wmi.md) and [Retrieving Amended Classes Using the COM API for WMI](retrieving-amended-classes-using-the-com-api-for-wmi.md).
