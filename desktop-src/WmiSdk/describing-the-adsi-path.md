# Describing the ADSI Path

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) requires that you escape some characters with a backslash (\\) character when you use them in an LDAP Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI) path.

,=+<>\#;\\"

The escape character is only required for the **ADSIPath** property value.

The following example shows how to define the **ADSIPath** property. Note that the \# character in the **CN** property value of abc\# is escaped.


```C++
// #include <windows.h> for this code to compile

BSTR strObjPath = 
    SysAllocString(L"ds_user.ADSIPath=\"LDAP://CN=abc\#,"
                   L"CN=Users,DC=dsprovider,DC=nttest,"
                   L"DC=microsoft,DC=com\"");

// Use strObjectPath here.

SysFreeString(strObjPath); // Free memory resources.
```
