# Date and Time Format

WMI uses the date and time formats defined by the Distributed Management Task Force ([DMTF.org](https://www.dmtf.org/)) Common Information Model (CIM) specification.

The **CIM\_DATETIME** format is implemented in the Microsoft [Managed Object Format (MOF)](managed-object-format--mof-.md) by the [DATETIME](datetime.md) MOF datatype. The date and time formats can also express an interval of time.

For more information about WMI formats, see [CIM\_DATETIME](cim-datetime.md) and [Interval Format](interval-format.md).

For more information about converting to and from the WMI DATETIME format, see [**SWbemDateTime**](swbemdatetime.md) and the article on TechNet ScriptCenter [It's About Time (Oh, and About Dates, too)](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/07/ScriptingGuy/default.aspx).
