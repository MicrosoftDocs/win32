# Accessing Active Directory

Active Directory is the directory service for Windows and is the foundation of Windows distributed networks. You can use Active Directory to locate objects in a computer network domain, such as users, security policies, printers, distributed components, and other resources. The name Active Directory refers both to the directory service and the directory itself.

> For more information about support and installation of this component on a specific operating system, see [Operating System Availability of WMI Components](operating-system-availability-of-wmi-components.md).

 

Windows makes Active Directory accessible through WMI by creating a set of references to every class and object contained in Active Directory. By accessing the Directory Services provider through WMI, you can create WMI-enabled applications that can access the wealth of information contained in Active Directory.

With these interfaces, you can:

-   Retrieve classes and instances.
-   Enumerate classes and instances.
-   Create new instances.
-   Modify existing instances.
-   Delete existing instances.
-   Query Active Directory.
