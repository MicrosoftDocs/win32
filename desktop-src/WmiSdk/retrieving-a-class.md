# Retrieving a WMI Class

The first type of object you can retrieve is a WMI class. When retrieving a WMI class, you actually retrieve a class definition, which is a listing of the properties, qualifiers, and methods that fully describe the class. However, a class definition is basically the class itself.

PowerShell uses a standard query to retrieve class definitions, using the **meta\_class** class.

**To retrieve a class definition in PowerShell**

-   Use the [Get-WmiObject](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-wmiobject) with a query to **meta\_class**, with the WHERE clause containing the name of the class you with to retrieve.

    ```PowerShell
    Get-WmiObject -query "SELECT * FROM meta_class WHERE __class = 'Win32_LogicalDisk'"
    ```

    

    [Get-WmiObject](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-wmiobject) is the standard cmdlet PowerShell uses to retrieve class and instance information from WMI. The **meta\_class** class defines the query as a schema query. Without the **meta\_class** class, this query would return all instances of Win32\_LogicalDisk. For more information about querying WMI, see [SELECT Statement for Schema Queries](select-statement-for-schema-queries.md).

The current process for retrieving a WMI definition in C# is to use **CIMInstance** class.

**To retrieve a class definition in C# (Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure)**

1.  Using the **Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure** namespace, create a **CIMInstance** class with the specified namespace and class name.

    The created class will contain all of the class information, but no instance data.

    ```CSharp
    using Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure;
    ...
    string Namespace = @"root\cimv2";
    string className = "Win32_LogicalDisk";

    CimInstance diskDrive = new CimInstance(className, Namespace);
    ```

    

2.  Alternately, as with PowerShell, you could also perform a query, using the **meta\_class** tag as part of the query.

    ```CSharp
    using Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure;
    ...
    string Namespace = @"root\cimv2";
    string diskDriveQuery = "SELECT * FROM meta_class WHERE __class = 'Win32_LogicalDisk'";

    CimSession mySession = CimSession.Create("localhost");
    IEnumerable<CimInstance> queryInstance = mySession.QueryInstances(Namespace, "WQL", diskDriveQuery);
    ```

    

As with PowerShell, C# uses a **meta\_class** query to retrieve class definitions. Alternately, you can create a **ManagementClass** object to access the class definition directly.

> [!Note]  
> **System.Management** was the original .NET namespace used to access WMI; however, the APIs in this namespace generally are slower and do not scale as well relative to their more modern **Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure** counterparts.

 

**To retrieve a class definition in C# (System.Management)**

1.  You can use the [ManagementObjectSerarcher](/dotnet/api/system.management.managementobjectsearcher) with a query to **meta\_class**, with the WHERE clause containing the name of the class you with to retrieve.

    ```CSharp
    using System.Management;
    ...
    ManagementObjectSearcher searcher = new ManagementObjectSearcher("SELECT * FROM meta_class WHERE __class = 'Win32_LogicalDisk'");
    ManagementObjectCollection myDiskCollection = searcher.Get();
    ```

    

    [ManagementObjectSerarcher](/dotnet/api/system.management.managementobjectsearcher) is the standard class .NET uses to retrieve class and instance information from WMI. [ManagementObjectSerarcher.Get](/dotnet/api/system.management.managementobjectsearcher.get#System_Management_ManagementObjectSearcher_Get) returns a [ManagementObjectCollection](/dotnet/api/system.management.managementobjectcollection) that contains the schema definition class. The **meta\_class** class defines the query as a schema query. Without the **meta\_class** class, this query would return all instances of [**Win32\_LogicalDisk**](/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32-logicaldisk). For more information about querying WMI, see [SELECT Statement for Schema Queries](select-statement-for-schema-queries.md).

2.  Alternately, create a new [ManagementClass](/dotnet/api/system.management.managementclass) object, with the name as the path, to retrieve the class.

    ```CSharp
    using System.Management;
    ...
    ManagementClass objInst = new ManagementClass("Win32_LogicalDisk");
    ```

    

You can retrieve a class definition in VBScript in a similar way to retrieving a specific instance.

**To retrieve a class definition in VBScript**

1.  Call [**SWbemServices.Get**](swbemservices-get.md) but do not identify a specific instance in the object path for the class.
2.  The following code example retrieves the class definition for the class that describes logical drives on your computer.

    ```VB
    Set objinst = GetObject("WinMgmts:Win32_LogicalDisk")
    ```

    

    Windows Script Host (WSH) also supports the following.

    ```VB
    <OBJECT id="myLocator" progid="WbemScripting.SWbemLocator"></OBJECT>
    ```

    

    On Active Server Pages (ASP) use [**GetObject**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e9waz863(v=VS.71).aspx) or [CreateObject](/previous-versions//xzysf6hc(v=vs.85)) in the server-side script. For more information, see [Creating Active Server Pages for WMI](creating-active-server-pages-for-wmi.md).

3.  A class or instance can also be specified, in which case the returned object is a WMI object, for example, an instance of [**Win32\_LogicalDisk**](/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32-logicaldisk), rather than a services object. Note that you cannot use the VBScript [**GetObject**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e9waz863(v=VS.71).aspx) functions to create an instance of the generic object [**SWbemObject**](swbemobject.md).
4.  In HTML pages running in Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), [**GetObject**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e9waz863(v=VS.71).aspx) and [CreateObject](/previous-versions//xzysf6hc(v=vs.85)) can fail because WMI scripting objects, like ActiveX controls, are not marked as safe for scripting. The one exception is the [**SWbemDateTime**](swbemdatetime.md) object. The only way that these calls can succeed is when you lower the IE security settings, which is not recommended.

When retrieving a class in C++, call the [**IWbemServices**](/windows/desktop/api/WbemCli/nn-wbemcli-iwbemservices) version of [**GetObject**](/windows/desktop/api/WbemCli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemservices-getobject).

**To retrieve a class definition in C++**

1.  Call the [**IWbemServices::GetObject**](/windows/desktop/api/WbemCli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemservices-getobject) or [**IWbemServices::GetObjectAsync**](/windows/desktop/api/WbemCli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemservices-getobjectasync) methods to retrieve the definition of a class.
2.  One class can have multiple class definitions, which happens typically when you have more than one class provider loaded into one namespace. When a class has multiple class definitions, WMI returns the first definition discovered and the **WBEM\_S\_DUPLICATE\_OBJECTS** status code.

Because [**GetObject**](/windows/desktop/api/WbemCli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemservices-getobject) returns a class definition, it is commonly used as the first step in creating an instance. For more information on how to use **GetObject**, see [Creating and Declaring an Instance Using C++](creating-and-declaring-an-instance-using-c-.md).
