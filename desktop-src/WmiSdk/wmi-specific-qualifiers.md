# WMI-Specific Qualifiers

In addition to the CIM qualifiers, WMI provides a number of additional qualifiers to further refine the provision of class instances and operations.

The following is a list of additional qualifiers that WMI provides:

-   [Standard WMI Qualifiers](standard-wmi-qualifiers.md)
-   [Qualifiers Specific to the SNMP Provider](qualifiers-specific-to-the-snmp-provider.md)
-   [Qualifiers Specific to the View Provider](qualifiers-specific-to-the-view-provider.md)
-   [Qualifiers Specific to the WDM Provider](qualifiers-specific-to-the-wdm-provider.md)
-   [Qualifiers Specific to WMI Performance Classes](qualifiers-specific-to-wmi-performance-classes.md)

In addition to qualifiers, flavors describing the behavior of qualifiers may be applied to the various qualifiers. For more information, see [Qualifier Flavors](qualifier-flavors.md).
