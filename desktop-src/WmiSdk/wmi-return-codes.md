# WMI Return Codes

This section provides a list of the WMI return codes, symbolic constants, literal values, and descriptions. These codes may be returned by scripts, C++ applications, or [**Wmic**](wmic.md) commands.

If an error occurs, WMI returns one of the following error codes as a 32-bit value where the two high-order bits indicate the severity code of the message.

<dl> <dt>

<span id="0"></span>0
</dt> <dd>

Success

</dd> <dt>

<span id="1"></span>1
</dt> <dd>

Informational

</dd> <dt>

<span id="2"></span>2
</dt> <dd>

Warning

</dd> <dt>

<span id="3"></span>3
</dt> <dd>

Error

</dd> </dl>

> [!Note]
>
> If WMI returns error messages, be aware that they may not indicate problems in the WMI service or in WMI providers. Failures can originate in other parts of the operating system and emerge as errors through WMI. Under any circumstances, do not delete the WMI repository as a first action because deleting the repository can cause damage to the system or to installed applications.
