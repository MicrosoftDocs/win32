# Operating System Availability of WMI Components

WMI is installed by default on all Windows desktop and server platforms. However, certain WMI providers may or may not be installed, depending on the OS release and configuration. For example, the SNMP provider is not enabled by default, and the Windows Installer provider (MSI provider) is not installed by default on 64-bit operating systems. For more information about the availability of a specific provider, see [WMI Providers](/windows/desktop/SrvNodes/wmi-mi-omi-providers).
