# Adding an ActiveX Control to a Visual C++ Project

The following procedure adds dispatch class and header files for an ActiveX control to a Visual C++ project.

**To add an ActiveX control to a Visual C++ Project**

1.  On the **Project** menu, click **Add to Project**. A shortcut menu appears.
2.  Click **Components and Controls**. The **Components and Controls Gallery** dialog box appears.
3.  Click the component to add to your project. Visual C++ displays a dialog box from which you can select a subset of the component's classes to add to your project.
4.  Click to select the check boxes of the classes you want to add, and click **OK**.

Visual C++ generates dispatch class and header files for the component and adds them to your project.
