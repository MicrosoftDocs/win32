# Registration and Licensing

A control is usually provided as an in-process server (.DLL), although it can also be a local or remote server (.EXE).

A control typically supports self-registration and creates a set of registry entries when it is instantiated. A control can also be licensed to help prevent unauthorized use. See [The Component Object Model](the-component-object-model.md) for more information on self registration and licensing.

For more information, see [ActiveX Controls Registry Information](activex-controls-registry-information.md).
