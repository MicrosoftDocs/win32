# Translating to VBScript

VBScript is a subset of the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications language. Because VBScript is intended to be safe for use in client-side applications such as webpages, it does not provide file input and output or direct access to the underlying operating system. This prevents a Web-based script from deleting or altering files on your computer. For a complete list of Visual Basic features that are not supported in VBScript, see the Visual Basic for Applications documentation.

In addition to the language features provided by VBScript, the scripting host may also expose a VBScript object model that your script can access. For example, Internet Explorer exposes an object model that enables scripts to interact with and programmatically control the browser. For more information about working with such object models, see the documentation on your scripting host.
