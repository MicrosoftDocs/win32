# Using OleView

While the Registry Editor shows an unprocessed view of the registry and is helpful for learning the organization of the registry, using the Registry Editor can be time-consuming.

OleView provides a higher-level view of the information contained in the registry. Rather than looking at a long list of CLSIDs, OleView features tree controls with friendly names.
