# Registering Objects in the ROT

Typically, when a client asks a server to create an object instance, the server typically creates a moniker for the object and registers it in the running object table (ROT) through a call to [**IRunningObjectTable::Register**](/windows/desktop/api/ObjIdl/nf-objidl-irunningobjecttable-register).

When the server calls [**CreateFileMoniker**](/windows/desktop/api/Objbase/nf-objbase-createfilemoniker) to create a file moniker to be registered in the ROT, servers should pass local file names that are drive-based, not in UNC format. This ensures that the moniker comparison data that is generated by the ROT register call will match what is used while doing a ROT lookup on the part of a remote client. This is because when the distributed COM service receives an activation request for a file local to the server from a remote client, the file is converted to a local-drive-based path.
