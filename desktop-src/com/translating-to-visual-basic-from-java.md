# Translating to Visual Basic from Java

Visual Basic uses Automation-compatible data types as its internal data types. Thus, Java data types that are Automation-compatible are also compatible with Visual Basic. Data types that are not Automation-compatible may not be able to be converted to Visual Basic.

Java and Visual Basic differ slightly in how they represent properties. In Java, properties are represented as a set of accessor functions, one that sets the property value and one that retrieves the property value. In Visual Basic, properties are represented as a single item that can be used to retrieve or set the property value.
