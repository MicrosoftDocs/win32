# Registry Hierarchy

The registry is structured as a hierarchy of keys, subkeys, and named values or single default values. Subkeys can have multiple subkeys and values. Keys are named by backslash-delimited strings. Each key in the registry can have one or more values, which can contain strings, integral values, or binary data.
