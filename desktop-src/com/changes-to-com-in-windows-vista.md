# Changes to COM in Windows Vista

The following changes were made to COM in Windows Vista:

-   The COM elevation moniker allows applications that are running under a limited user account (LUA) to activate COM classes with elevated functionality. For more information, please see [The COM Elevation Moniker](the-com-elevation-moniker.md).
-   When you install an application that makes COM calls on a Windows Vista computer, and you plan to run the application as an administrator, you must install the application per-machine, rather than per-user, or it will not function properly.
