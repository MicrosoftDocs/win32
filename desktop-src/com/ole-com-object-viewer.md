# OLE-COM Object Viewer

The OLE-COM object viewer, Oleview.exe, is an application supplied with Visual C++ that displays the COM objects installed on your computer and the interfaces they support. You can use this object viewer to view type libraries.

To view a COM object's type library:

1.  On the object viewer **File** menu, click **View TypeLib**. An **Open** dialog box appears.
2.  Specify the type library file you want to open, and click **OK**.

The object viewer displays the object's interfaces.

For more information, see [Using the OLE/COM Object Viewer](/previous-versions/d0kh9f4c(v=vs.140)) in the Visual C++ documentation.
