# COM Language Translations

Components created using the Component Object Model (COM) can be reused in applications written in any programming language that supports COM. This is because COM is a binary standard and, as such, is language-independent.

COM objects are documented in the most relevant programming language or languages. For example, objects that are created for use in webpages are typically documented in the Microsoft Visual Basic development system, whereas system-level objects are typically documented in C++. However, because COM is language-neutral, you are not limited to using an object in the same language in which it is written or documented. For example, you can write an application in JScript that uses a control created in C++ and documented in Visual Basic.

The following topics discuss the differences between programming languages and describe how to translate COM object syntax from one language to another. Additional topics describe how to use COM objects in various scripting languages and environments.

-   [Syntax Differences](syntax-differences.md)
-   [Data Type Conversions](data-type-conversions.md)
-   [IDL Files](idl-files.md)
-   [Translating COM Object Syntax for Programming Languages](translating-com-object-syntax-for-programming-languages.md)
-   [Scripting with COM Objects](scripting-with-com-objects.md)

The intent is to address the most common language translation issues that arise when using COM objects. The techniques and principles described apply to any programming or scripting language that supports COM. Because scripting languages and programming languages represent different programming paradigms, translation between scripting languages and programming languages is not addressed.
