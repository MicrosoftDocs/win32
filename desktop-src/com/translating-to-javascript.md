# Translating to JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting language that was created by Netscape. It was originally called LiveScript. Despite the similarities in name and syntax, JavaScript is not related to the Java programming language. Java is a full-featured programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc.

JavaScript is supported by a wide range of Web browsers, including both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.

In addition to the language features provided by JavaScript, the scripting host may also expose an object model that your script can access. For example, Internet Explorer exposes an object model that enables scripts to interact with and programmatically control the browser. For more information about working with such object models, see the documentation on your scripting host.

For more information about JavaScript, see a JavaScript reference.
