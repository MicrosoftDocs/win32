# DllSurrogate

Enables DLL servers to run in a surrogate process. If an empty string is specified, the system-supplied surrogate is used; otherwise, the value specifies the path of the surrogate to be used.

## Registry Entry

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\AppID
   {AppID_GUID}
      DllSurrogate = path
```

## Remarks

This is a **REG\_SZ** value that specifies that the class is a DLL that is to be activated in a surrogate process, and the surrogate process to be used. To use the system-supplied generic surrogate process, set *path* to an empty string or **NULL**. To specify another surrogate process, set *path* to the path of the surrogate. As in the specification of the path of a server under the [**LocalServer32**](localserver32.md) key, a full path specification is not necessary. The surrogate must be written to properly communicate with the DCOM service as described in [Writing a Custom Surrogate](writing-a-custom-surrogate.md).

The **DllSurrogate** value must be present for a DLL server to be activated in a surrogate. Activation refers to a call to [**CoGetClassObject**](cogetclassobject.md), [**CoCreateInstanceEx**](cocreateinstanceex.md), **CoCreateInstanceEx**, [**CoGetInstanceFromFile**](cogetinstancefromfile.md), [**CoGetInstanceFromIStorage**](cogetinstancefromistorage.md), or [**IMoniker::BindToObject**](imoniker-bindtoobject.md). Running DLLs in a surrogate process provides the benefits of an executable implementation, including fault isolation, the ability to serve multiple clients simultaneously, and allowing the server to provide services to remote clients in a distributed environment.
