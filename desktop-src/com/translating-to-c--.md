# Translating to C++

Visual C++ provides several tools to assist you in adding COM objects to your project. You can add an ActiveX control to your project, use the MFC Class Wizard, or run the MIDL compiler on an IDL file.

If you are using a C++ development environment other than Visual C++, consult that product's documentation for information on COM conversion tools.

Once you have added the COM object's include or stub files to your project, your application can use the COM object's classes.

Visual C++ also provides the OLE-COM Object Viewer, which you can use to view compiled type library information. The object viewer presents the COM classes in C++ syntax.
