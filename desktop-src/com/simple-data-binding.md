# Simple Data Binding

The ActiveX controls architecture defines a data-binding mechanism, whereby an ActiveX control can specify that one or more of its properties are bindable. In most cases, a data-bound control should not absolutely require data binding, so that it could be inserted into a container that does not support data binding. Obviously, in such a situation, the functionality of the control may be reduced.
