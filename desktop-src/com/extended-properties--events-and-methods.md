# Extended Properties, Events and Methods

ActiveX control containers are not required to support extended controls. However, if the control container does support extended properties, then it must support the following minimal set:

-   Visible
-   Parent
-   Default
-   Cancel

Currently, extended properties, events, and methods do not have standard dispids.
