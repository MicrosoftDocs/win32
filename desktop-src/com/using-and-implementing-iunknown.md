# Using and Implementing IUnknown

COM provides a rich set of standards for implementing and using objects and for inter-object communication. The topics in this section describe basic information relating to implementing objects. For information about how clients and servers interact, see [COM Clients and Servers](com-clients-and-servers.md). For more information about threading models and their implementation and use, see [Processes, Threads, and Apartments](processes--threads--and-apartments.md).

For details on using and implementing [**IUnknown**](/windows/desktop/api/Unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown), see the following topics:

-   [QueryInterface: Navigating in an Object](queryinterface--navigating-in-an-object.md)
-   [Rules for Implementing QueryInterface](rules-for-implementing-queryinterface.md)
-   [Managing Object Lifetimes Through Reference Counting](managing-object-lifetimes-through-reference-counting.md)
