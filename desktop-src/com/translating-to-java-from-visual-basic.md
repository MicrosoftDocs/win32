# Translating to Java from Visual Basic

By default, Visual Basic passes parameters by reference. Parameters that are meant to be passed by value only are specified by the keyword **ByVal**.

Java does not support multidimensional arrays. Methods that accept or return multidimensional arrays are not available from Java.

Java and Visual Basic differ slightly in how they represent properties. In Java, properties are represented as a set of accessor functions, one that sets the property value and one that retrieves the property value. In Visual Basic, properties are represented as a single item that can be used to retrieve or set the property value.
