# Linking and Embedding

Users can create two types of compound-document objects: *linked* or *embedded*. The difference between the two types lies in how and where the object's source data is stored. Where the object resides affects, in turn, the object's portability and methods of activation, how data updates are performed, and the size and structure of its container.
