# Application Identity

An application's identity is the account that is used to run the application. The identity can be that of the user that is currently logged on (the interactive user), the user that launched the server, a specified user, or a service. To learn how to set application identity using Dcomcnfg.exe, see [Setting Processwide Security Using DCOMCNFG](setting-processwide-security-using-dcomcnfg.md).

The following topics describe each of the four types of application identity and explain the limitations of each type:

-   [Interactive User](interactive-user.md)
-   [Launching User](launching-user.md)
-   [Specified User](specified-user.md)
-   [Service Identity](service-identity.md)
