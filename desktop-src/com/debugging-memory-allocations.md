# Debugging Memory Allocations

COM provides the [**IMallocSpy**](/windows/desktop/api/ObjIdl/nn-objidl-imallocspy) interface for developers to use to debug their memory allocations. For each method in [**IMalloc**](/windows/win32/api/objidlbase/nn-objidlbase-imalloc), there are two methods in **IMallocSpy**, a "pre" method and a "post" method. After a developer implements it and publishes it to the system, the system calls the **IMallocSpy** "pre" method just before the corresponding **IMalloc** method, effectively allowing the debug code to "spy" on the allocation operation, and calls the "post" method to release the spy.

For example, when COM detects that the next call is a call to [**IMalloc::Alloc**](/windows/desktop/api/ObjIdl/nf-objidl-imalloc-alloc), it calls [**IMallocSpy::PreAlloc**](/windows/desktop/api/ObjIdl/nf-objidl-imallocspy-prealloc), executing whatever debug operations the developer wants during the **Alloc** execution, and then, when the **Alloc** call returns, calls [**IMallocSpy::PostAlloc**](/windows/desktop/api/ObjIdl/nf-objidl-imallocspy-postalloc) to release the spy and return control to the code.
