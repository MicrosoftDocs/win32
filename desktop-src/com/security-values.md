# Security Values

Several values affect security for COM applications, including authentication level, impersonation level, cloaking, application identity, software restriction policy configuration, and reference tracking.

For more information, see the following topics:

-   [Authentication Level](authentication-level.md) describes how to help control the amount of protection for communication between COM objects.
-   [Delegation and Impersonation](delegation-and-impersonation.md) explains how cloaking affects the identity presented to the server during impersonation and how the client grants the server the authority to act on its behalf.
-   [Application Identity](application-identity.md) identifies and explains the identities your application can use.
-   [Software Restriction Policy](software-restriction-policy.md) explains how to help protect your system from the dangers associated with running unknown code.
-   [Reference Tracking](reference-tracking.md) explains how you can ensure that objects are not released too early.
