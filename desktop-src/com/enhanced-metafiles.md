# Enhanced Metafiles

Not surprisingly, enhanced metafiles provide more functionality than standard metafiles; using enhanced metafiles generally simplifies rendering code. An enhanced metafile DC is used in exactly the same way as a standard metafile DC. OLE supports enhanced metafiles, and includes backward compatibility with standard metafiles.

ActiveX control containers should use enhanced metafiles instead of standard metafiles.
