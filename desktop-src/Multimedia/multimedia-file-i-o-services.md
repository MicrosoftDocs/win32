# Multimedia File I/O Services

\[The feature associated with this page, [Multimedia File I/O](/windows/win32/multimedia/multimedia-file-i-o), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Source Reader](/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader). **Source Reader** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Source Reader** instead of **Multimedia File I/O**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This section describes procedures for using the following multimedia file I/O services:

-   [Basic Services](basic-services.md)
-   [Buffered Services](buffered-services.md)
-   [Resource Interchange File Format Services](resource-interchange-file-format-services.md)
-   [Custom Services](custom-services.md)
