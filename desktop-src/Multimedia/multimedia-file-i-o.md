# Multimedia File I/O

\[The feature associated with this page, [Multimedia File I/O](/windows/win32/multimedia/multimedia-file-i-o), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Source Reader](/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader). **Source Reader** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Source Reader** instead of **Multimedia File I/O**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The multimedia file I/O services provide more functionality than the standard operating system services, including support for buffered I/O, resource interchange file format (RIFF) files, memory files, and custom storage systems. In addition, the multimedia file I/O services are optimized for applications sensitive to performance.
