# Multimedia PC Specifications

The Multimedia PC (MPC) Marketing Council has developed two specifications to encourage the adoption of multimedia capabilities. The Level 1 specification, developed in 1990, provides a baseline definition of multimedia computing in functionality, hardware components, and software components. The Level 2 specification, issued in 1993, builds on the first specification and focuses on enhanced multimedia capabilities since the first specification was issued.

This appendix summarizes the specifications.
