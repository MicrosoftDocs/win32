# MIDI Services

Most applications will be able to use the MCI MIDI sequencer or stream buffers (and the [**midiStreamOut**](/windows/win32/api/mmeapi/nf-mmeapi-midistreamout) function) to implement all the MIDI functionality they need. Serious MIDI developers — those producing MIDI authoring or sequencing tools — can use either a combination of the stream capabilities and the MIDI services or use only the MIDI services. The following topics provides general information about using the MIDI services.

-   [Querying MIDI Devices](querying-midi-devices.md)
-   [Opening and Closing Device Drivers](opening-and-closing-device-drivers.md)
-   [Allocating and Preparing MIDI Data Blocks](allocating-and-preparing-midi-data-blocks.md)
-   [Managing MIDI Data Blocks](managing-midi-data-blocks.md)
-   [Requesting Time Formats](requesting-time-formats.md)
