# Stream Operations

\[The feature associated with this page, [AVIFile Functions and Macros](/windows/win32/multimedia/avifile-functions-and-macros), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Source Reader](/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader). **Source Reader** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Source Reader** instead of **AVIFile Functions and Macros**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Most of the features of AVIFile focus on data streams. This section describes the functions and macros that deal with streams and stream data.
