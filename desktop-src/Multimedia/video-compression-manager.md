# Video Compression Manager

The video compression manager (VCM) provides access to the interface used by installable compressors to handle real-time data. Applications can use installable compressors to perform the following tasks:

-   Compress and decompress video data.
-   Send a renderer compressed video data and have it draw it to the display.
-   Compress, decompress, or draw data with application-defined renderers.
-   Use renderers to handle text and custom data.
