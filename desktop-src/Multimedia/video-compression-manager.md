# Video Compression Manager

\[The feature associated with this page, [AVIFile Functions and Macros](/windows/win32/multimedia/avifile-functions-and-macros), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Source Reader](/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader). **Source Reader** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Source Reader** instead of **AVIFile Functions and Macros**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The video compression manager (VCM) provides access to the interface used by installable compressors to handle real-time data. Applications can use installable compressors to perform the following tasks:

-   Compress and decompress video data.
-   Send a renderer compressed video data and have it draw it to the display.
-   Compress, decompress, or draw data with application-defined renderers.
-   Use renderers to handle text and custom data.
