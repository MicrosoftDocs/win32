# Determining Which Interface an Object Supports

\[The feature associated with this page, [Custom File and Stream Handlers](/windows/win32/multimedia/custom-file-and-stream-handlers), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaStreamSource class](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Core.MediaStreamSource). **MediaStreamSource class** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaStreamSource class** instead of **Custom File and Stream Handlers**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **QueryInterface** method lets an application query an object to determine which interfaces it supports. The sample application sets the *ppv* pointer to the current interface.


```C++
STDMETHODIMP CAVIFileCF::QueryInterface( 
    const IID FAR& iid, 
    void FAR* FAR* ppv) 
{ 
    if (iid == IID_IUnknown) 
        *ppv = this;                     // set the interface pointer 
                                         // to this instance 
    else if (iid == IID_IClassFactory) 
        *ppv = this;                     // second chance to set the 
                                         // interface pointer to this 
                                         // instance 
    else 
        return ResultFromScode(E_NOINTERFACE); 
    AddRef();  //Increment the reference count 
    return NULL; 
} 

```
