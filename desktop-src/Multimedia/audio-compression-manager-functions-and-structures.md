# Audio Compression Manager Functions and Structures

The ACM functions fall into several categories. Naming conventions for the functions make it easy to identify these categories. Function names (with two exceptions) are of the form *acmGroupFunction*, where *Group* designates the ACM category (such as "Driver," "Format," "FormatTag," "Filter," "FilterTag," or "Stream"), and *Function* describes the action performed by the function.

The functions in the filter and format groups are very similar. Almost every function that acts on filters has a parallel function that acts on formats.

In the format group, some functions use waveform-audio format tags (the **wFormatTag** member of a [**WAVEFORMATEX**](/windows/win32/api/mmeapi/ns-mmeapi-waveformatex) structure) while others require full waveform-audio formats (the full **WAVEFORMATEX** structure). (For reference information about the **WAVEFORMATEX** structure, see [Error](error.md).)

In the filter group, some functions use waveform-audio filter tags (the **dwFilterTag** member of a [**WAVEFILTER**](/windows/desktop/api/Mmreg/ns-mmreg-wavefilter) structure), while others require full waveform-audio filters (the full **WAVEFILTER** structure).

The functions in the stream group represent the many steps involved in a conversion: opening a conversion instance, preparing for the conversion, performing the conversion, cleaning up after the conversion is complete, and closing the conversion instance.
