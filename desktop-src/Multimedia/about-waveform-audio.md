# About Waveform Audio

There are several methods for adding sound to your application using waveform audio. The simplest method documented here is that of using the [**PlaySound**](/previous-versions//dd743680(v=vs.85)) function. Most of the other waveform-audio API elements are relatively low-level.

For more information, see the following topics:

-   [Simple Audio Playback](simple-audio-playback.md)
-   [Waveform-Audio Interface](waveform-audio-interface.md)
-   [Auxiliary Audio Interface](auxiliary-audio-interface.md)
-   [Audio Data Blocks](audio-data-blocks.md)
-   [Handling Errors with Audio Functions](handling-errors-with-audio-functions.md)

In addition to the APIs discussed here, the Media Control Interface can be used to play waveform audio as well as other media such as MIDI sounds and video. For more information, see [MCI](mci.md).
