# Recording Waveform Audio

\[The feature associated with this page, [Waveform Audio](/windows/win32/multimedia/waveform-audio), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [WASAPI](/windows/win32/coreaudio/wasapi) and [Audio Graphs](/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/audio-graphs). **WASAPI** and **Audio Graphs** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **WASAPI** and **Audio Graphs** instead of **Waveform Audio**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The following topics describe how to use the waveform-audio interface to record audio.
