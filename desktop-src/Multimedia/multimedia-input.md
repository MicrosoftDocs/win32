# Multimedia Input

\[The feature associated with this page, [Waveform Audio](/windows/win32/multimedia/waveform-audio), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [WASAPI](/windows/win32/coreaudio/wasapi) and [Audio Graphs](/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/audio-graphs). **WASAPI** and **Audio Graphs** have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **WASAPI** and **Audio Graphs** instead of **Waveform Audio**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Windows provides functions that enable an application to receive multimedia input. The multimedia input functions were introduced in 16-bit Windows. Many of their features have been superseded by features in DirectX. For more information, see the DirectX documentation.

The following topics are discussed in the multimedia input documentation.

-   [Multimedia File I/O](multimedia-file-i-o.md)
-   [Joysticks](joysticks.md)
-   [Multimedia Timers](multimedia-timers.md)
