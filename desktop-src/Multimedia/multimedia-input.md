# Multimedia Input

Windows provides functions that enable an application to receive multimedia input. The multimedia input functions were introduced in 16-bit Windows. Many of their features have been superseded by features in DirectX. For more information, see the DirectX documentation.

The following topics are discussed in the multimedia input documentation.

-   [Multimedia File I/O](multimedia-file-i-o.md)
-   [Joysticks](joysticks.md)
-   [Multimedia Timers](multimedia-timers.md)
