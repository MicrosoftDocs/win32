# Working with MCI Devices

\[The feature associated with this page, [MCI](/windows/win32/multimedia/mci), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **MCI**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The following topics describe how to work with MCI devices and provide shortcuts you can use with MCI commands:

-   [Opening a Device](opening-a-device.md)
-   [Retrieving Information About a Device](retrieving-information-about-a-device.md)
-   [Obtaining MCI System Information](obtaining-mci-system-information.md)
-   [Playing a Device](playing-a-device.md)
-   [Recording](recording.md)
-   [Stopping, Pausing, and Resuming a Device](stopping-pausing-and-resuming-a-device.md)
-   [Closing a Device](closing-a-device.md)
