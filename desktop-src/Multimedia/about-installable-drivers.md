# About Installable Drivers

An installable driver is a dynamic-link library (DLL) that provides a standard interface through which Windows-based applications and DLLs communicate with and manage the driver. Installable drivers are used most commonly for as multimedia device drivers, but installable drivers can also be used for other purposes and are particularly useful in situations that require a standard interface and control of multiple instances.
