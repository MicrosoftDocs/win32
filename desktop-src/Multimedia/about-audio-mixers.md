# About Audio Mixers

\[The feature associated with this page, [Audio Mixers](/windows/win32/multimedia/audio-mixers), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Volume Controls](/windows/win32/coreaudio/volume-controls). **Volume Controls** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Volume Controls** instead of **Audio Mixers**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Audio mixer services control the routing of audio lines to a destination device for playing or recording. These services can also control volume and other effects. Many of the techniques required to use these services are similar to those for audio devices discussed in other multimedia overviews.
