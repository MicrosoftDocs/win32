# Multimedia Timers

\[The feature associated with this page, [Joysticks](/windows/win32/multimedia/joysticks), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Windows.Gaming.Input Namespace](/uwp/api/windows.gaming.input). **Windows.Gaming.Input Namespace** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Windows.Gaming.Input Namespace** instead of **Joysticks**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The multimedia timer services allow an application to schedule periodic timer events — that is, the application can request and receive timer messages at application-specified intervals.
