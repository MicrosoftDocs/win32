# ICM\_DRAW\_SUGGESTFORMAT message

The **ICM\_DRAW\_SUGGESTFORMAT** message queries a rendering driver to suggest a decompressed format that it can draw.


```C++
ICM_DRAW_SUGGESTFORMAT 
wParam = (DWORD_PTR) (LPVOID) &icdrwSuggest; 
lParam = sizeof(ICDRAWSUGGEST); 
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

<span id="icdrwSuggest"></span><span id="icdrwsuggest"></span><span id="ICDRWSUGGEST"></span>*icdrwSuggest*
</dt> <dd>

Pointer to an [**ICDRAWSUGGEST**](/windows/desktop/api/Vfw/ns-vfw-icdrawsuggest) structure.

</dd> <dt>

<span id="lParam"></span><span id="lparam"></span><span id="LPARAM"></span>*lParam*
</dt> <dd>

Size, in bytes, of [**ICDRAWSUGGEST**](/windows/desktop/api/Vfw/ns-vfw-icdrawsuggest).

</dd> </dl>

## Return Value

Returns ICERR\_OK if successful. If the **lpbiSuggest** member of the [**ICDRAWSUGGEST**](/windows/desktop/api/Vfw/ns-vfw-icdrawsuggest) structure is **NULL**, this message returns the amount of memory required to contain the suggested format.

## Remarks

The driver should examine the format specified in the **lpbiIn** member of the [**ICDRAWSUGGEST**](/windows/desktop/api/Vfw/ns-vfw-icdrawsuggest) structure and use the **lpbiSuggest** member to return a format it can draw. The output format should preserve as much data as possible from the input format.

Optionally, the driver can use the installable compressor handle passed in the **hicDecompressor** member of [**ICDRAWSUGGEST**](/windows/desktop/api/Vfw/ns-vfw-icdrawsuggest) to make more complex selections. For example, if the input format is 24-bit JPEG data, a renderer could query the decompressor to find out if it can decompress to a YUV format (which might be drawn more efficiently) before selecting the format to suggest.
