# Playing the AVI File

\[The feature associated with this page, [MCI](/windows/win32/multimedia/mci), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **MCI**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Before using the [**mciSendCommand**](/previous-versions//dd757160(v=vs.85)) function to send the [**MCI\_PLAY**](mci-play.md) command, your application allocates the memory for the structure, initializes the members it will use, and sets the flags corresponding to the members used in the structure. (If your application does not set a flag for a structure member, MCI drivers ignore the member.) For example, the following example plays a movie from the starting position specified by **dwFrom** to the ending position specified by **dwTo**. (If either position is zero, the example is written so that the position is not used.)


```C++
DWORD PlayMovie(WORD wDevID, DWORD dwFrom, DWORD dwTo) 
{ 
    MCI_DGV_PLAY_PARMS mciPlay;    // play parameters 
    DWORD dwFlags = 0; 
 
    // Check dwFrom. If it is != 0 then set parameters and flags. 
    if (dwFrom){ 
        mciPlay.dwFrom = dwFrom; // set parameter 
        dwFlags |= MCI_FROM;     // set flag to validate member 
    } 
 
    // Check dwTo. If it is != 0 then set parameters and flags. 
    if (dwTo){ 
        mciPlay.dwTo = dwTo;    // set parameter 
        dwFlags |= MCI_TO;      // set flag to validate member 
    } 
 
    // Send the MCI_PLAY command and return the result. 
    return mciSendCommand(wDevID, MCI_PLAY, dwFlags, 
       (DWORD)(LPVOID)&mciPlay); 
} 
```
