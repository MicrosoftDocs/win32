# Joystick Position

You can query a joystick for position and button information by using the [**joyGetPos**](/windows/win32/api/joystickapi/nf-joystickapi-joygetpos) function. For example, an application can query the joystick for baseline position values. The Joystick Control Panel property sheet uses this technique when calibrating the joystick.

You can also query a joystick or other device that has extended capabilities by using the [**joyGetPosEx**](/windows/win32/api/joystickapi/nf-joystickapi-joygetposex) function.
