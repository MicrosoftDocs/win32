# Level 2 Specification

The Level 2 specification was developed to encourage the adoption of enhanced multimedia capabilities. This specification builds on the requirements set in the Level 1 specification and is a superset of it. The Level 2 specification defines the minimum system functionality for enhanced multimedia capabilities. It is not a recommendation for a system configuration.
