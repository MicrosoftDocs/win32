# The Wait, Notify, and Test Flags

\[The feature associated with this page, [MCI](/windows/win32/multimedia/mci), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **MCI**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Most MCI commands include flags that modify the command. The "wait" (MCI\_WAIT) and "notify" (MCI\_NOTIFY) flags are common to every command. The "test" (MCI\_TEST) flag is available to digital-video and VCR devices. The following topics describe the use of these flags.

-   [The Wait Flag](the-wait-flag.md)
-   [The Notify Flag](the-notify-flag.md)
-   [The Test Flag](the-test-flag.md)
