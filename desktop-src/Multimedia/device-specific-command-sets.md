# Device-Specific Command Sets

\[The feature associated with this page, [MCI](/windows/win32/multimedia/mci), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **MCI**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The following topics list the commands supported by each device type:

-   [CD Audio Command Set](cd-audio-command-set.md)
-   [Digital-Video Command Set](digital-video-command-set.md)
-   [MIDI Sequencer Command Set](midi-sequencer-command-set.md)
-   [VCR Command Set](vcr-command-set.md)
