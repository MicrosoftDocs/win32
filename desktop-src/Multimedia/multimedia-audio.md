# Multimedia Audio

\[The feature associated with this page, [MCIWnd Window Class](/windows/win32/multimedia/mciwnd-window-class), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **MCIWnd Window Class**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Windows provides functions that enable an application to add audio services. The multimedia audio functions were introduced in 16-bit Windows. Many of their features have been superseded by features in DirectX. For more information, see the DirectX documentation.

The following topics are discussed in the multimedia audio documentation.

-   [Audio Compression Manager](audio-compression-manager.md)
-   [Audio Mixers](audio-mixers.md)
-   [Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)](musical-instrument-digital-interface--midi.md)
-   [Waveform Audio](waveform-audio.md)

Audio can also be played by using the Media Control Interface. For more information, see [MCI](mci.md).
