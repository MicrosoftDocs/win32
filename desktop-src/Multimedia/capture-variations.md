# Capture Variations

In addition to streaming capture based on a constant time interval, AVICap supports the following types of capture:

-   [Manual Frame Capture](manual-frame-capture.md) (programmable control frames that are captured)
-   [Still-Image Capture](still-image-capture.md)
-   [Capture Without Using Disk Storage](capture-without-using-disk-storage.md)
-   [Streaming Capture from an MCI Device](streaming-capture-from-an-mci-device.md) (real-time and step-frame)
