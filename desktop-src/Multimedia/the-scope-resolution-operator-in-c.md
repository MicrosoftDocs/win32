# The Scope Resolution Operator in C++

Two colons (::) are used in C++ as a *scope resolution* operator. This operator gives you more freedom in naming your variables by letting you distinguish between variables with the same name. For example, *MyFile::Read* refers to the *Read* method of the *MyFile* class of objects, as opposed to *YourFile::Read*, which refers to a *Read* method in the *YourFile* class.
