# Audio Mixer Custom Controls

\[The feature associated with this page, [Audio Mixers](/windows/win32/multimedia/audio-mixers), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Volume Controls](/windows/win32/coreaudio/volume-controls). **Volume Controls** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Volume Controls** instead of **Audio Mixers**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Custom controls are the most generic of the mixer controls. These controls allow a mixer driver to define the control's characteristics, and by implication, the visual representation of the control.
