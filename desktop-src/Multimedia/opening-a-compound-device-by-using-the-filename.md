# Opening a Compound Device by Using the Filename

\[The feature associated with this page, [MCI](/windows/win32/multimedia/mci), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **MCI**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The following example opens the waveform-audio device by specifying a waveform-audio file named "TIMPANI.WAV" using the [**mciSendCommand**](/previous-versions//dd757160(v=vs.85)) function.


```C++
UINT wDeviceID;
DWORD dwReturn;
MCI_OPEN_PARMS mciOpenParms;
 
// Opens a waveform-audio device by specifying the device and 
// file name.

mciOpenParms.lpstrDeviceType = "waveaudio";
mciOpenParms.lpstrElementName = "timpani.wav";

if (dwReturn = mciSendCommand(NULL, MCI_OPEN,
    MCI_OPEN_TYPE | MCI_OPEN_ELEMENT, (DWORD)(LPVOID) &mciOpenParms))
{
    
    // Error, unable to open device.
    
}

// The device opened successfully; get the device ID.
wDeviceID = mciOpenParms.wDeviceID;
```
