# Opening the Playback Window

\[The feature associated with this page, [MCI](/windows/win32/multimedia/mci), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **MCI**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The following example shows how to use the [**MCI\_OPEN**](mci-open.md) command to set a parent window and create a child of that window.


```C++
MCI_DGV_OPEN_PARMS    mciOpen; 
 
mciOpen.lpstrElementName = lpstrFile;  // Set the filename.
mciOpen.dwStyle = WS_CHILD;            // Set the style. 
mciOpen.hWndParent = hWnd;             // Give a window handle. 
 
if (mciSendCommand(0, MCI_OPEN, 
   (DWORD)(MCI_OPEN_ELEMENT|MCI_DGV_OPEN_PARENT|MCI_DGV_OPEN), 
   (DWORD)(LPSTR)&mciOpen) == 0)
{ 
    // Open operation is successful. Continue. 
} 
```
