# Changing the Playback State

The following examples show how to use the [**pause**](pause.md), [**resume**](resume.md), [**stop**](stop.md), and [**seek**](seek.md) commands in the [**mciSendString**](/previous-versions//dd757161(v=vs.85)) function.


```C++
// Assume the file was opened with the alias 'movie'. 
 
// Pause play. 
mciSendString("pause movie", NULL, 0, NULL); 
 
// Resume play. 
mciSendString("resume movie", NULL, 0, NULL); 
 
// Stop play. 
mciSendString("stop movie", NULL, 0, NULL); 
 
// Seek to the beginning. 
mciSendString("seek movie to start", NULL, 0, NULL); 
 
```



The following example shows how to change the seek mode:


```C++
// Set seek mode with the string interface. 
// Assume the file was opened with the alias 'movie'. 
 
void SetSeekMode(BOOL fExact) 
{ 
    if (fExact) 
        mciSendString("set movie seek exactly on", NULL, 0, NULL); 
    else 
        mciSendString("set movie seek exactly off", NULL, 0, NULL); 
} 
```
