# MCI Devices

Every MCI multimedia device supports a core set of MCI commands in a way that makes sense for that device. For example, the [**play**](play.md) ([**MCI\_PLAY**](mci-play.md)) command causes the open device to play a file or track, no matter what kind of data the device works with. The following topics discuss MCI devices and how they respond to standard MCI commands.

-   [Device Control](device-control.md)
-   [Playback and Positioning](playback-and-positioning.md)
-   [Device Types](device-types.md)
-   [Device Names](device-names.md)
-   [Driver Support for MCI Commands](driver-support-for-mci-commands.md)
-   [Default Behavior of Drivers](default-behavior-of-drivers.md)
