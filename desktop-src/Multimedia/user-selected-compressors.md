# User-Selected Compressors

When compressing data, your application can use the [**ICCompressorChoose**](/windows/desktop/api/Vfw/nf-vfw-iccompressorchoose) function to create a dialog box in which the user can select the compressor. You can specify flags for this function to allow the user to specify the key-frame frequency and the movie-data rate, or to display a preview window.

The compressor selected by the user is automatically opened and its handle is returned in the hic member of the [**COMPVARS**](/windows/desktop/api/Vfw/ns-vfw-compvars) structure specified in **ICCompressorChoose**.

If you use **ICCompressorChoose**, use the [**ICCompressorFree**](/windows/desktop/api/Vfw/nf-vfw-iccompressorfree) function to close the compressor and free any resources associated with the **COMPVARS** structure.
