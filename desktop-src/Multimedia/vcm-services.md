# VCM Services

In general, an application uses VCM to perform the following tasks:

-   Locate, open, or install a compressor or decompressor.
-   Configure or obtain configuration information about the compressor or decompressor.
-   Use a series of functions to compress, decompress, or draw the data.

The functions and macros of the DrawDib library perform these tasks implicitly and might provide the most convenient way to use VCM. For more information about the DrawDib library, see [DrawDib](drawdib.md).

The following sections describe tasks you can perform by using VCM:

-   [Compressor and Decompressor Basics](compressor-and-decompressor-basics.md)
-   [User-Selected Compressors](user-selected-compressors.md)
