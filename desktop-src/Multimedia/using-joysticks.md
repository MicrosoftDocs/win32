# Using Joysticks

This section contains examples demonstrating how to perform the following tasks:

-   [Getting the Driver Capabilities](getting-the-driver-capabilities.md)
-   [Capturing Joystick Input](capturing-joystick-input.md)
-   [Processing Joystick Messages](processing-joystick-messages.md)

The examples are taken from a simple joystick application that retrieves position and button-state information from the joystick services, plays waveform-audio resources, and paints bullet holes on the screen when a user presses the joystick buttons.
