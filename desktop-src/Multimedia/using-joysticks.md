# Using Joysticks

\[The feature associated with this page, [Joysticks](/windows/win32/multimedia/joysticks), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Windows.Gaming.Input Namespace](/uwp/api/windows.gaming.input). **Windows.Gaming.Input Namespace** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Windows.Gaming.Input Namespace** instead of **Joysticks**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This section contains examples demonstrating how to perform the following tasks:

-   [Getting the Driver Capabilities](getting-the-driver-capabilities.md)
-   [Capturing Joystick Input](capturing-joystick-input.md)
-   [Processing Joystick Messages](processing-joystick-messages.md)

The examples are taken from a simple joystick application that retrieves position and button-state information from the joystick services, plays waveform-audio resources, and paints bullet holes on the screen when a user presses the joystick buttons.
