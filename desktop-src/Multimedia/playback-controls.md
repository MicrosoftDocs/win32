# Playback Controls

\[The feature associated with this page, [MCIWnd Window Class](/windows/win32/multimedia/mciwnd-window-class), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **MCIWnd Window Class**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

MCIWnd includes several macros for controlling playback. This section describes how to use these macros to perform the following tasks:

-   [Determining and Changing the Current Position](determining-and-changing-the-current-position.md)
-   [Starting, Pausing, and Resuming Playback](starting-pausing-and-resuming-playback.md)
-   [Defining Playback Scope](defining-playback-scope.md)
-   [Reversing Playback](reversing-playback.md)
-   [Looping Playback](looping-playback.md)
