# MCI Implementations for Specific Devices

\[The feature associated with this page, [MCI](/windows/win32/multimedia/mci), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **MCI**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The following topics discuss using MCI commands with specific MCI devices:

-   [MCIAVI](mciavi.md)
-   [VCR Services](vcr-services.md)
