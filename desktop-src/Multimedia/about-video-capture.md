# About Video Capture

AVICap supports streaming video capture and single-frame capture in real-time. In addition, AVICap provides control of video sources that are Media Control Interface (MCI) devices so the user can control (through an application) the start and stop positions of a video source, and augment the capture operation to include step frame capture.

The windows you create by using the AVICap window class can perform the following tasks:

-   Capture audio and video streams to an audo-video interleaved (AVI) file.
-   Connect and disconnect video and audio input devices dynamically.
-   View a live incoming video signal by using the overlay or preview methods.
-   Specify a file to use when capturing and copy the contents of the capture file to another file.
-   Set the capture rate.
-   Display dialog boxes that control the video source and format.
-   Create, save, and load palettes.
-   Copy images and palettes to the clipboard.
-   Capture and save a single image as a device-independent bitmap (DIB).
