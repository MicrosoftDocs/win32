# Joysticks

\[The feature associated with this page, [Joysticks](/windows/win32/multimedia/joysticks), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Windows.Gaming.Input Namespace](/uwp/api/windows.gaming.input). **Windows.Gaming.Input Namespace** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Windows.Gaming.Input Namespace** instead of **Joysticks**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This overview describes the functions and messages that support joysticks, as well as other ancillary input devices that track positions within an absolute coordinate system, such as a touch screen, digitizing tablet, and light pen. Extended capabilities also provide support for rudder pedals, flight yokes, and other devices that use up to six axes of movement, a point-of-view hat, and 32 buttons.

The multimedia joystick API has been superseded by DirectInput, which has more capabilities for today's input and force-feedback devices. For more information, see the DirectX documentation.
