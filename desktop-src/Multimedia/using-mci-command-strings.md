# Using MCI Command Strings

\[The feature associated with this page, [MCI](/windows/win32/multimedia/mci), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **MCI**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

This section contains examples demonstrating how to use the MCI command-string interface to perform the following tasks:

-   [Sending a Command](sending-a-command.md)
-   [Opening Multiple AVI Files](opening-multiple-avi-files.md)
-   [Changing the Playback State](changing-the-playback-state.md)
-   [Converting Strings](converting-strings.md)
