# Level 1 Specification

The Level 1 specification was developed to encourage the adoption of basic multimedia capabilities at a minimum performance level. The most common multimedia components available to the marketplace when the Level 1 specification was issued included several compact disc – read-only memory (CD-ROM) drives that provided data at sustained transfer rates varying from 90 to 150 kilobytes per second, 8-bit sound cards, and 16-color and 256-color (SVGA) video adapters.
