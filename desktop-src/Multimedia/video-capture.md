# Video Capture (Windows Multimedia)

\[The feature associated with this page, [Video Compression Manager](/windows/win32/multimedia/video-compression-manager), is a legacy feature. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code does not use this feature.\]

You can easily incorporate video capture capabilities into your application by using the AVICap window class. AVICap provides applications with a simple, message-based interface to access video and waveform-audio acquisition hardware and to control the process of streaming video capture to disk.
