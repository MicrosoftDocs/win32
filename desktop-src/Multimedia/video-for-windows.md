# Video for Windows

\[The feature associated with this page, [Multimedia Timers](/windows/win32/multimedia/multimedia-timers), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Multimedia Class Scheduler Service](/windows/win32/procthread/multimedia-class-scheduler-service). **Multimedia Class Scheduler Service** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **Multimedia Class Scheduler Service** instead of **Multimedia Timers**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Video for Windows (VFW) provides functions that enable an application to process video data. VFW was introduced in 16-bit Windows. Many of its features have been superseded by features in DirectX. For more information, see the DirectX documentation.
