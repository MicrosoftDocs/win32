# Richer Application Experiences

Windows 7 enables developers to create distinctive and intuitive applications that significantly enhance discoverability, usability, and sheer enjoyment. New methods of desktop integration put application functionality right at the user's fingertips, and Windows Explorer and *Libraries* provide easy access to high-value information. The Windows Ribbon control and Windows Animation framework make it easier to build interactive and appealing user interfaces. New touch APIs enable natural interactions through multi-touch and finger-panning, and manipulation and inertia APIs enable impressive visual effects.

Rapid advances in hardware and software technology are also driving higher-fidelity user experiences. Windows 7 brings these advances under developer control with new and flexible APIs that take full advantage of the technology, while making it even easier to develop compelling applications.
