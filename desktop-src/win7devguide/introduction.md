# Introduction (Windows 7 Developer Guide)

Developing software has never been more exciting. The world has never been more connected, interactive and mobile. User experiences and content have never had higher fidelity. Advances in connectivity, mobility, natural interfaces, graphics and media are enabling new scenarios and opportunities for developers. At the same time, expectations have never been higher for performance, flexibility and interoperability. A world-class developer platform must provide a flexible and complete foundation for developers and their solutions, empowering them to build applications that set them apart from the competition while maximizing their investments.

The Windows 7 operating system is the essential platform for developers. Listening to our customers, looking ahead to the scenarios of tomorrow, and building on the capabilities of Windows Vista, Microsoft offers developers a wide variety of choices and capabilities within the Windows developer platform, while empowering developers to deliver creative solutions that are mobile-aware, connected, high-fidelity, and provide a highly intuitive user experience. Most importantly, developer platform fundamentals such as security, performance, and compatibility are top priorities in Windows 7.

This guide summarizes the key developer advances in each of the following three areas:

[Solid Foundation](solid-foundation.md)

Great user experiences start with a solid foundation. Windows 7 delivers a solid development platform and innovative tools that give you more options, increased application compatibility, better performance, and sophisticated document support. This results in a simple, more reliable environment for your applications and a familiar, intuitive one for your users.

We've kept the user interface consistent, predictable and easy to use, while adding multi-touch support, scrolling, and other intuitive interaction features that take advantage of the latest PC and mobile device capabilities. With Windows 7, developers have the power to build the right user experiences for their applications. (See [Windows User Experience Interaction Guidelines](/windows/apps/desktop/).)

[Richer Application Experiences](richer-application-experiences.md)

Windows 7 enables developers to build applications today that will run on the PCs of tomorrow. Service-enabled software and devices, such as mobile phones, portable media players, and digital cameras, demand constant connectivity and advanced applications. Windows 7 delivers a platform for both, making it easy for developers to take advantage of the functionality and features of next generation hardware, while ensuring that users are always on, and always connected.

[The Best of Windows and the Web](the-best-of-windows-and-the-web.md)

With Windows 7, it's easy to get connected and stay connected. Windows networking offers developers options for better caching and sharing of data to improve network performance. Network diagnostics in Windows 7 give developers relevant information for monitoring network issues. Windows Internet Explorer 8 is the essential platform for building fast, rich web experiences. Whether the goal is to connect devices, connect to a network, or connect to the *Internet*, Windows 7 provides an enhanced platform.
