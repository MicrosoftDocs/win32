# D1200: PushLayer with Multisampled Target

Pushlayer/Poplayer was used with a multisampled target. The call will still be issued, but the rendered result will may not represent the multisample pattern expected.






 

## Possible Causes

The application interoperated a multisampled Direct3D texture as a Direct2D target, and called PushLayer on the target.

## Possible Fixes

Avoid interoperating multisampled textures if layer functionality is important. Using layers or clips with these types of resources may incur a performance penalty or unexpected rendering results. If possible, use an alternative means of controlling opacity or masking instead of layers. Or, use an intermediate instead of a multisampled resource. If the multisampled resource is intended for anti-aliasing 2D content, consider whether Direct2D’s built-in per-primitive antialiasing is sufficient.
