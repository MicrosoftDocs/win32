# D1152: Command List Closed Twice

An attempt was made to close a command list for a second time.






 

## Possible Causes

After populating a command list, it need only be closed once. Direct2D considers subsequent calls to ID2D1CommandList::Close to be an error.

## Possible Fixes

To avoid this message, ensure that a command list is only closed once. If an application uses callbacks or recursive code paths to interact with command lists, ensure that its behavior is correct.
