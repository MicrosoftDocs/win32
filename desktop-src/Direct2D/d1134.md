# D1134: Buffer Precision Disallowed By Caps

The device does not have the capability to support the given buffer precision.






 

## Possible Causes

Direct2D allows an application to specify a desired buffer precision for some operations. For example, the precision used for the imaging pipeline is specified using [**ID2D1DeviceContext::SetRenderingControls**](/windows/win32/api/d2d1_1/nf-d2d1_1-id2d1devicecontext-setrenderingcontrols(constd2d1_rendering_controls)). Hardware Direct2D devices, however, may not support all buffer precisions, depending on their feature level. For example, feature level 9 devices may not support buffer precision options other than 8 bits-per-channel.

## Possible Fixes

For applications which run on hardware, ensure that the all buffer precision specifiers are supported by the hardware’s feature level. Consider using [**ID3D11Device::CheckFormatSupport**](/windows/desktop/api/d3d11/nf-d3d11-id3d11device-checkformatsupport) and [**ID3D11Device::CheckFeatureSupport**](/windows/desktop/api/d3d11/nf-d3d11-id3d11device-checkfeaturesupport) to gain more information about what formats are supported by the hardware, and to determine what surface precisions will be allowed. For consistent operation with all feature level 9 devices, design a fallback mechanism to avoid high-precision buffers.
