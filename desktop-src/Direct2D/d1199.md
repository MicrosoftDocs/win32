# D1199: Changed Command List Resource

An image drawn to a command list has just been changed. This may produce unintended consequences. The command list will now contain the changed image rather than the contents of image at the time that it was drawn.






 

## Possible Causes

The application added an image to to a command list and later changed the image.

## Possible Fixes

Verify that the resulting behavior is as expected. The behavior in this case, where a command list is the target, will produce different results than if a bitmap were set as the target. If the behavior is not as expected, the application may wish to clone the image before updating it.
