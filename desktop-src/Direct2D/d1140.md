# D1140: Stroke Transform Type Uses Default DPI

When widening an ID2D1Geometry with a FIXED or HAIRLINE stroke, Direct2D will assume a DPI of 96. When rendering the widened geometry, the stroke width may change.






 

## Possible Causes

When Direct2D draws a geometry to a target, it widens the geometry. However, an application may also construct ID2D1Geometry objects without a target and widen them, using methods of ID2D1Geometry such as Widen, StrokeContainsPoint, and GetWidenedBounds. During these operations, an application may use D2D1\_STROKE\_TRANFORM\_TYPE\_HAIRLINE or FIXED. These attributes normally consider a DPI, but in absence of a target, no DPI is specified. This informational message warns that Direct2D will consider a default DPI of 96.0.

## Possible Fixes

This message is informational only, and does not necessarily indicate a problem with the application.
