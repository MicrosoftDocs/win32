# D1240: Source Tranform Still Mapped

The bitmap passed to ID2D1SourceTransform::Draw was never unmapped.






 

## Possible Causes

The application called ID2D1Bitmap1::Map but did not call ID2D1Bitmap1::Unmap on a bitmap passed to ID2D1SourceTransform::Draw.

## Possible Fixes

Make sure Unmap is called whenever Map is called.
