# D1128: DXGI Format Not Supported In Any API

The DXGI format passed into this API is not supported by Direct2D.





 

## Possible Causes

Some surface formats are not compatible with Direct2D operations regardless of the how they are used. This message indicates that the application should choose another surface format.

## Possible Fixes

See [Supported Pixel Formats and Alpha Modes](supported-pixel-formats-and-alpha-modes.md) for guidance concerning which formats are supported and which are not. If the application must render to a single channel and is attempting to use a red-channel-only format which is not supported, consider changing it to render to an alpha-channel-only format.
