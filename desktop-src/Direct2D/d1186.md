# D1186: DC Render Target Requires BindDC

It is invalid to use a DC render target before calling its BindDC method.






 

## Possible Causes

The application created an ID2D1DCRenderTarget and used it to call BeginDraw, but did not yet call its BindDC method. Or, BindDC resulted in an error.

## Possible Fixes

Before using a DC-interopped render target, applications should call BindDC to associate the target to a GDI device context. The target is not considered to be valid until a GDI device context has been assigned. See ID2D1DCRenderTarget::BindDC for an example. If the application already calls BindDC, ensure that BindDC did not return an error.
