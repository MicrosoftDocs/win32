# D1173: Texture Cube Interop Unsupported

Textures flagged as D3D11RESOURCE\_MISC\_TEXTURECUBE may not be used by Direct2D.






 

## Possible Causes

The application attempted to interop a Direct3D texture with the D3D11RESOURCE\_MISC\_TEXTURECUBE option specified.

## Possible Fixes

Refrain from interoperating textures which have the TEXTURECUBE specifier. Instead, reorganize the application’s rendering design or consider interoperating an intermediate.
