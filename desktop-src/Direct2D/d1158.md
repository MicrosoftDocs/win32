# D1158: Pixels Unit Mode Unsupported with Print

Direct2D Print: Unsupported SetUnitMode(PIXELS) command was present in command list sent for printing.





 

## Possible Causes

Direct2D Print does not allow a unit mode of PIXELS. The default unit mode is DIPS.

## Possible Fixes

To address this message, refrain from setting the device context’s unit mode to PIXELS while creating printable content. If it is necessary to apply a global scale transform which affects all primitive-drawing operations, consider whether an equivalent call to ID2D1RenderTarget::SetDpi or ID2D1RenderTarget::SetTransform is sufficient.
