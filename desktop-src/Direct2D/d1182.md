# D1182: Operation On Unclosed Path Geometry

An operation has occurred on a path geometry that was not closed.






 

## Possible Causes

The application began populating an ID2D1PathGeometry, but did not call ID2D1SimplifiedGeometrySink::Close on its populating sink. Or, the application called Close, but an error value was returned.

## Possible Fixes

Ensure that all path geometries are populated correctly by calling Close on their populating sink, and ensuring that Close did not return an error. See the reference for ID2D1PathGeometry for an example of how to create and populate a path geometry object.
