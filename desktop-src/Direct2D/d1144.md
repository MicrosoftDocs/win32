# D1144: Effect Is Not A Target

SetTarget failed because an effect was passed as a target.






 

## Possible Causes

ID2D1DeviceContext::SetTarget takes an ID2D1Image\* parameter. Direct2D images may be bitmaps, command lists or effects. Direct2D only considers bitmaps and command lists to be valid targets.

## Possible Fixes

Modify the application to use a bitmap or command list as its device context’s target. Direct2D does not perform initialization of effects using SetTarget. Rather, to choose the content of an effect, an application creates the effect using ID2D1DeviceContext::CreateEffect and uses a corresponding effect GUID.
