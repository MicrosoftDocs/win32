# D1136: Text Rendering Mode Conflict

The DWRITE\_RENDERING\_MODE and the D2D1\_TEXT\_ANTIALIAS\_MODE set on this render target are not compatible with one another.






 

## Possible Causes

For text-based operations such as ID2D1RenderTarget::DrawGlyphRun and ID2D1DeviceContext::GetGlyphRunWorldBounds, Direct2D considers the current text antialiasing option of the device context as well as the DirectWrite antialiasing option. Antialiasing semantics differ slightly between Direct2D and DirectWrite. This message occurs when the two antialiasing options specified do not agree.

## Possible Fixes

To ensure that the Direct2D text antialiasing mode agrees with the DirectWrite rendering mode, ensure that they meet the following requirements: • For D2D1\_TEXT\_ANTIALIAS\_MODE\_CLEARTYPE, the DirectWrite rendering mode may not be OUTLINE or ALIASED.• For D2D1\_TEXT\_ANTIALIAS\_MODE\_GRAYSCALE, the DirectWrite rendering mode may not be ALIASED.• For D2D1\_TEXT\_ANTIALIAS\_MODE\_ALIASED, the DirectWrite rendering mode may not be any of the CLEARTYPE options. \[newline\] To change the current Direct2D text antialiasing mode, use ID2D1RenderTarget::SetTextAntialiasMode.
