# D1130: DXGI Format Disallowed By Caps

The device does not have the capability to support the given DXGI format.






 

## Possible Causes

For Direct2D operations which are executed on hardware and use a surface format, the surface format must be supported by the feature level of the hardware. For example, if hardware is feature level 9, it may not support 16bpp formats or SRGB formats, such as DXGI\_FORMAT\_B8G8R8A8\_UNORM\_SRGB.

## Possible Fixes

See [Direct3D feature levels](/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh994923(v=win.10)) for guidance concerning the differences between feature levels and their supported formats. Consider using the [**ID3D11Device::CheckFormatSupport method**](/windows/desktop/api/d3d11/nf-d3d11-id3d11device-checkformatsupport) to verify that the required format is supported by the hardware before using it with Direct2D.
