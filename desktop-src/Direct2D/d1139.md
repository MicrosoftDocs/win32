# D1139: Unused Stroke Width

A stroke transform type of HAIRLINE was specified, but the stroke width supplied was not 1. The stroke width will be ignored.






 

## Possible Causes

The application drew a primitive using an ID2D1StrokeStyle with D2D1\_STROKE\_TRANSFORM\_TYPE\_HAIRLINE, but the stroke width used in that draw call was not 1. When the hairline attribute is specified, it, in fact, overrides the stroke width, fixing it at 1.0 device-dependent units, regardless of scale transform or DPI choice.

## Possible Fixes

When the HAIRLINE attribute is set on an ID2D1StrokeStyle, the application should use a stroke width of 1.0 units.
