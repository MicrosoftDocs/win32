## Possible Causes

The application interoperated a multisampled Direct3D texture as a Direct2D bitmap, and called CopyFromBitmap on the bitmap.

## Possible Fixes

Avoid interoperating multisampled textures as bitmaps if CopyFromBitmap functionality is important. The copied result may not represent the multisample pattern expected.
