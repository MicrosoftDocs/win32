# D1203: CopyFromBitmap With Multisampled Source

CopyFromBitmap was used with a multisampled source bitmap. The call will still be issued, but the copied result will may not represent the multisample pattern expected.






 

## Possible Causes

The application interoperated a multisampled Direct3D texture as a Direct2D bitmap, and called CopyFromBitmap on the bitmap.

## Possible Fixes

Avoid interoperating multisampled textures as bitmaps if CopyFromBitmap functionality is important. The copied result may not represent the multisample pattern expected.
