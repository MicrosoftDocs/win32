# D1163: Print Bitmap Too Big

Bitmap is too large for printing, consider breaking it up in smaller tiles.






 

## Possible Causes

Direct2D Print imposes a limit on the sizes of printable bitmaps. This limit is 65535 device-dependent units. If the application includes a bitmap exceeding this size in printable content, Direct2D will report an error and the debug layer will output this message.

## Possible Fixes

Ensure that bitmaps used in printing operations do not exceed Direct2D Print’s size limit. Consider partitioning the bitmap into multiple tiles.
