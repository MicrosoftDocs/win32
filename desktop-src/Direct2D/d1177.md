# D1177: Unsupported WIC Pixel Format

The WIC pixel format supplied is not supported by Direct2D. In particular, Direct2D does not support WIC bitmaps that use straight alpha unless the depth is 8bpp.






 

## Possible Causes

The application attempted to interoperate a WIC resource whose format is not supported by Direct2D. Typically, these formats are those with straight-alpha, and whose depth is not 8 bits per plane.

## Possible Fixes

Consider creating the WIC resource using an alternative format for interoperability with Direct2D, or converting it.
