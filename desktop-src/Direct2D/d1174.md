# D1174: PushLayer To Command List Will Ignore Layer Object

When pushing a (non-NULL) layer to a command list, the layer object will be ignored.





 

## Possible Causes

When a PushLayer command uses an ID2D1Layer object, and the target is a command list, Direct2D will behave as if no layer was specified, and will not impose fixed boundries on the layer if the command list is later rendered.

## Possible Fixes

Applications that anticipate streaming commands to a command list should consider using NULL layer objects, or otherwise be aware that the size restriction settings specified in the ID2D1Layer object will not be honored.
