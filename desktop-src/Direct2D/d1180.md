# D1180: BeginDraw Incorrect State

BeginDraw was called multiple times, without a corresponding call to EndDraw.






 

## Possible Causes

The application made multiple calls to BeginDraw without calling EndDraw on the same target. While using Direct2D, applications should match each call to BeginDraw with a subsequent EndDraw. Alternatively, this message may occur if the target is in an erroneous state, and the BeginDraw call did not allow the target to be renderable.

## Possible Fixes

Ensure that each call to BeginDraw is matched with a subsequent EndDraw. When submitting commands to a target using Flush or EndDraw, verify that the returned result is S\_OK before attempting to use the target again.
