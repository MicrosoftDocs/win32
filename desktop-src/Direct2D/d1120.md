# D1120: Invalid Attempt to Draw Bitmap

An operation failed because the bitmap has the D2D1\_BITMAP\_OPTIONS\_CANNOT\_DRAW option.





 

## Possible Causes

This message occurs when an application attempts to draw a bitmap flagged with D2D1\_BITMAP\_OPTIONS\_CANNOT\_DRAW. This includes direct calls to DrawBitmap, as well as the drawing of primitives using a bitmap brush.

## Possible Fixes

The CANNOT\_DRAW flag is used for correctly annotating resources which are usable as targets only, such as swap chain backbuffers. However, it is also permitted to omit the CANNOT\_DRAW flag for some target bitmaps if they may also be used as a source. If this is the case, simply omit the CANNOT\_DRAW flag. If the bitmap must be annotated with CANNOT\_DRAW because of its exclusive use as a target or to allow CPU-lockability, consider using a staging texture with the same size as the desired source but without the CANNOT\_DRAW designation. Copy to the staging texture using ID3D11DeviceContext::CopyResource, and use the staging texture as a source for the drawing operation. The use of a staging texture gives rise to performance implications; they may be acceptable if the source bitmap does not change often.
