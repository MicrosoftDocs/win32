# D1151: Unsupported Array Selection

The IDXGISurface2 supplied belongs to an array, but array slices are not supported on this device level (D3D9).






 

## Possible Causes

Interopped Direct3D textures may be arrayed; Direct2D will only operate on one array slice at a time. Other array slices of the parent texture will be not be affected or rendered to by Direct2D. However, feature level 9 devices do not support array slice selection and cannot use this interoperability feature.

## Possible Fixes

For applications which are expected to run properly on feature level 9 devices, consider modifying the rendering logic to avoid the need to interoperate arrayed textures. If possible, interoperate an intermediate instead. To minimize the effects of working around this limitation, the application may choose to implement this as a feature level 9-specific fallback path.
