# D1233: BeginDraw Invalid From Previous Error

BeginDraw was called but will be ignored because the device context is in an invalid state.






 

## Possible Causes

The application called BeginDraw, but the device context was in an invalid state from a previous operation.

## Possible Fixes

Ensure that the application responds appropriately to errors returned by Flush or EndDraw, recreating its device as necessary. If a command caused a device context to be in an invalid state, the corresponding Flush or EndDraw will return an error.
