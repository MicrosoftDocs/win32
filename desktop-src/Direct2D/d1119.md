# D1119: Bitmap Bound As Target

A drawing operation failed because the target bitmap and a source bitmap were the same.






 

## Possible Causes

A likely cause of this message is that the application attempted a drawing operation where the same bitmap was used for both the source and target. Semantically, this is possible for interoperated Direct3D textures with both BIND\_SHADER\_RESOURCE and BIND\_RENDER\_TARGET.

## Possible Fixes

Ensure that the application does not attempt to use its target bitmap as the source of a drawing operation, including effects. In some cases, this message may indicate that the application set its device context’s target to a different bitmap than intended.
