# D1141: Print Requires sRGB Color Space

Direct2D Print: Custom Color Space is not supported. Using sRGB instead.






 

## Possible Causes

When creating a Direct2D print control, an application uses a D2D1\_PRINT\_CONTROL\_PROPERTIES with a color space attribute. Direct2D supports [**D2D1\_COLOR\_SPACE\_CUSTOM**](/windows/desktop/api/D2d1_1/ne-d2d1_1-d2d1_color_space) for some operations, such as creation of a color context using ICC data. While creating a print control, however, Direct2D supports only built-in color spaces such as sRGB or scRGB.

## Possible Fixes

To address the message, specify a non-custom color space such as sRGB or scRGB while creating a print control. The message does not indicate an error, but it indicates that Direct2D will ignore the CUSTOM specifier and create the print control using an sRGB color space.
