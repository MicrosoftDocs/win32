# D1227: Print Rasterization Event

This message is emitted from Direct2D print. It indicates that one of the following operations caused a need for rasterization:

-   Use of a D2D1\_LAYER\_OPTIONS1\_INITIALIZE\_FROM\_BACKGROUND layer.
-   Use of the primitive blend mode SOURCE COPY, or any blend mode other than SOURCE OVER.
-   Use of certain composite modes such as BOUNDED\_SOURCE\_COPY, DESTINATION\_OUT, SOURCE\_ATOP, XOR, PLUS, or INVERT.
-   Use of [**DrawGdiMetafile**](id2d1devicecontext-drawgdimetafile-overload.md).
-   Use of a 4x4 (or, perspective) transformation in a [**DrawBitmap**](id2d1devicecontext-drawbitmap-overload.md) call.

For optimal performance, these operations should be avoided if possible.
