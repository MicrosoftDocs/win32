# D1118: Target Not A Bitmap

A drawing operation failed because the target is NULL or a command list.





 

## Possible Causes

A likely cause of this message is that the application called GetDC or ReleaseDC while its device context’s target was set to NULL, or to a command list.

## Possible Fixes

If an application uses GetDC or ReleaseDC exposed by IGdiInteropRenderTarget, ensure that the corresponding ID2D1DeviceContext has a valid bitmap set as its target.
