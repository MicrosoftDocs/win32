# D1148: Invalid Operation On Closed Print Control

Direct2D Print: [**AddPage**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Hh847998(v=VS.85).aspx) or [**Close**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Hh848001(v=VS.85).aspx) is called after [**ID2D1PrintControl**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Hh847997(v=VS.85).aspx) was closed

## Possible Causes

This message may occur if an application calls ID2D1PrintControl::AddPage on a print control which has been closed. Direct2D considers print control objects to be unchangeable after they are closed, in a similar manner as path geometries and command lists.

## Possible Fixes

Ensure that the application does not attempt to add pages to a closed print control. Modify application logic so that all required pages are sent to a print control before it is closed.
