# D1230: Unknown Buffer Precision Support

A call to IsBufferPrecisionSupported was made with D2D1\_BUFFER\_PRECISION\_UNKNOWN. This API returns false, though D2D1\_BUFFER\_PRECISION\_UNKNOWN may be valid as an input to some APIs.






 

## Possible Causes

A call to IsBufferPrecisionSupported was made with D2D1\_BUFFER\_PRECISION\_UNKNOWN.

## Possible Fixes

Determine whether D2D1\_BUFFER\_PRECISION\_UNKNOWN is a valid buffer precision for a given API by reading the documentation for that API rather than trying to determine this programatically.
