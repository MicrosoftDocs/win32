# D1149: Print Detected An Invalid Unicode Character

Direct2D Print: Invalid Unicode character detected in DWRITE\_GLYPH\_RUN\_DESCRIPTION.string. It was replaced with space (0x20).






 

## Possible Causes

Direct2D Print considers invalid characters noted in [Unicode documentation](https://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#utf16-7), as well as certain ASCII characters outside of the visible range, to be non-printable. Use of these characters does not cause an error. Rather, Direct2D Print will substitute these characters with spaces.

## Possible Fixes

To avoid this notification, do not use malformed Unicode characters or non-printable ASCII while drawing text for printability.
