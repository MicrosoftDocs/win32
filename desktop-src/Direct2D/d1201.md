# D1201: PushAxisAlignedClip With Antialiased Multisampled Target

PushAxisAlignedClip was used with a multisampled target. The call will still be issued, but artifacts may be arise if the bounds of the clip rectangle are non-pixel-aligned. Additionally, the rendered result will may not represent the multisample pattern expected.






 

## Possible Causes

The application interoperated a multisampled Direct3D texture as a Direct2D target, and called PushAxisAlignedClip on the target.

## Possible Fixes

Avoid interoperating multisampled textures if clip functionality is important. Using layers or clips with these types of resources may incur a performance penalty or unexpected rendering results. This is particularly true if the bounds of the clip are not pixel-aligned. If possible, use an alternative means of masking content instead of a clip, such as a Direct3D scissor. Or, use an intermediate instead of a multisampled resource. If the multisampled resource is intended for anti-aliasing 2D content, consider whether Direct2D’s built-in per-primitive antialiasing is sufficient.
