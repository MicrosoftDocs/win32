# D1171: Redundant Call To Map Bitmap

An attempt was made to Map a bitmap that is already mapped.






 

## Possible Causes

Direct2D may output this message and report an error if an application attempts to map a bitmap which was already mapped using ID2D1Bitmap1::Map.

## Possible Fixes

In the same way that ID2D1RenderTarget::EndDraw should follow calls to ID2D1RenderTarget::BeginDraw, ensure that ID2D1Bitmap1::Unmap follows calls to ID2D1Bitmap1::Map. If an application uses callbacks or recursive code paths to map bitmaps, ensure that its behavior is correct.
