# D1202: CopyfromRenderTarget With Multisampled Source

CopyFromRenderTarget was used with a multisampled rendertarget. The call will still be issued, but the copied result will may not represent the multisample pattern expected.






 

## Possible Causes

The application interoperated a multisampled Direct3D texture as a Direct2D target, and called CopyFromRenderTarget on the target

## Possible Fixes

Avoid interoperating multisampled textures as targets if CopyFromRenderTarget functionality is important. The copied result may not represent the multisample pattern expected.
