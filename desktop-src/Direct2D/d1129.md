# D1129: DXGI Format Incompatible With Alpha Mode

The combination of alpha mode and DXGI format supplied are not compatible with one another.





 

## Possible Causes

For Direct2D operations which use a surface format and alpha mode, there are cases in which the surface format and the alpha mode do not agree. For example, a surface format such as DXGI\_FORMAT\_A8\_UNORM would not make sense to be used with IGNORE alpha, since it renders only to an alpha channel. Additionally, straight alpha is not supported with some DXGI\_FORMATs, but premultiplied alpha is.

## Possible Fixes

See [Supported Pixel Formats and Alpha Modes](supported-pixel-formats-and-alpha-modes.md) for guidance concerning which format combinations are supported and which are not. Modify the application to use a supported format combination.
