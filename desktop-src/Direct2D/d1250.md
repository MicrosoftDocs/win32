# D1250: Inaccessible Source

An attempt to draw from an inaccessible bitmap has been detected.






 

## Possible Causes

An attempt to draw from an inaccessible source has been detected. One reason a source may be inacessible is if it was created from a shared texture and the texture was not acquired.

## Possible Fixes

Make sure all bitmaps are accessible before drawing them with Direct2D.
