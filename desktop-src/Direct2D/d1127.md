# D1127: Alpha Mode Mismatch

The alpha mode passed into this API is not compatible with the pixel format of the \[*surface*\].

## Placeholders

<dl> <dt>

<span id="surface"></span><span id="SURFACE"></span>*surface*
</dt> <dd>

The Direct3D surface that does not support the alpha mode.

</dd> </dl> 



 

## Possible Causes

Operations such as ID2D1RenderTarget::CreateBitmapFromWicBitmap or ID2D1RenderTarget::CreateDxgiSurfaceRendertarget require both a surface and a specified surface alpha mode. Direct2D verifies that the specified alpha mode is compatible with the surface. If it is not compatible, Direct2D will output this message.

## Possible Fixes

Modify the application to use an ALPHA\_MODE that matches, or is compatible with, the alpha mode of the underlying surface. See [Supported Pixel Formats and Alpha Modes](supported-pixel-formats-and-alpha-modes.md) for additional guidance on the alpha modes exposed by Direct2D.
