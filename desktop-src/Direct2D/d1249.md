# D1249: Inaccessible Target

An attempt to draw to an inaccessible target has been detected.






 

## Possible Causes

An attempt to draw to an inaccessible target has been detected. One reason a target may be inaccessible is if it was created from a shared texture and the texture was not acquired.

## Possible Fixes

Make sure all targets are accessible before rendering to them with Direct2D.
