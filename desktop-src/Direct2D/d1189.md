# D1189: CPU Read Bitmap Option Was Used Incorrectly

D2D1\_BITMAP\_OPTIONS\_CPU\_READ must be combined with D2D1\_BITMAP\_OPTIONS\_CANNOT\_DRAW






 

## Possible Causes

The application specified an incompatible combination of the D2D1\_BITMAP\_OPTIONS flags.

## Possible Fixes

Remove one of the flags in order to create a valid set of D2D1\_BITMAP\_OPTIONS.
