# D1121: Wrong Resource Domain

An operation failed because a device-dependent resource is associated with the wrong ID2D1Device (resource domain).






 

## Possible Causes

This message occurs when an application has attempted a drawing operation that mixes resources from different resource domains. Device contexts, brushes, and bitmaps, for example, are device-specific. While performing an operation such as ID2D1DeviceContext::DrawBitmap, the argument bitmap should belong to the same resource domain as the device context. In this example, a way to ensure this is to create the bitmap using that device context’s CreateBitmap member function, rather than that of some other device context.

## Possible Fixes

When groups of resources should be used together, ensure they are created from the same ID2D1Device. Non-target resources created directly from an ID2D1Factory, such as state blocks and geometries, and are considered device-independent and do not have this restriction.
