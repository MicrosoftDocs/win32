# D1147: Print Control Closed Without AddPage

Direct2D Print: Close is called with no previous AddPage calls

## Possible Causes

This message may occur if an [**ID2D1PrintControl**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Hh847997(v=VS.85).aspx) is closed without any prior invocation to [**ID2D1PrintControl::AddPage**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Hh847998(v=VS.85).aspx). Direct2D Print considers a print control with no pages to be erroneous, and the corresponding [**ID2D1PrintControl::Close**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Hh848001(v=VS.85).aspx) command will return an error.

## Possible Fixes

To address the message, add a page to the print control before closing it. If the application need not print any content, refrain from closing the print control, or creating it at all.
