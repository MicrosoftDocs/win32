# Direct2D samples

The following samples demonstrate the Direct2D API.

## Windows 10 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 samples

| Sample | Description |
|-|-|
| [Direct2D custom image effects sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/D2DCustomEffects) | This sample demonstrates how to implement [Custom effects](custom-effects.md) using HLSL pixel, vertex, and compute shaders. |
| [Direct2D gradient mesh sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/D2DGradientMesh) | This sample demonstrates how to instantiate and render a gradient mesh in Direct2D. This samples uses the helper method provided by Direct2D to create a mesh consisting of two tensor patches that share a side. |
| [Direct2D photo adjustment sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/D2DPhotoAdjustment) | This sample demonstrates how to build a photo viewer and editor using Direct2D and Direct2D Effects. |

## Windows 8 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 samples

| Sample | Description |
|-|-|
| [Direct2D composite effect modes sample](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/msdn-code-gallery-microsoft/tree/master/Official%20Windows%20Platform%20Sample/Direct2D%20basic%20image%20effects%20sample) | This sample shows the wide range of composite and blend modes available from Direct2D. |
| [Direct2D basic image effects sample](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/msdn-code-gallery-microsoft/tree/master/Official%20Windows%20Platform%20Sample/Direct2D%20basic%20image%20effects%20sample) | This sample shows how to load an image, apply the Gaussian blur effect to it, and then display it in a Windows::UI::Core::CoreWindow. |
| [JPEG YCbCr optimizations in Direct2D and WIC sample](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/msdn-code-gallery-microsoft/tree/master/Official%20Windows%20Platform%20Sample/JPEG%20YCbCr%20optimizations%20in%20Direct2D%20and%20WIC%20sample) | Demonstrates performance optimizations in Direct2D and the Windows Imaging Component rendering image data in the JPEG YCbCr format natively. |
| [DirectX postcard app sample](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/msdn-code-gallery-microsoft/tree/master/Official%20Windows%20Platform%20Sample/DirectX%20postcard%20app%20sample) | This sample demonstrates the end-to-end implementation of a simple Windows Store app using DirectX with C++ for postcard creation using DirectX and XAML interop. |
