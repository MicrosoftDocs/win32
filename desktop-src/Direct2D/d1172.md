# D1172: Invalid To Unmap Nonmapped Bitmap

An attempt was made to Unmap a bitmap that is not mapped.






 

## Possible Causes

Direct2D may output this message and report an error if an application attempts to unmap a bitmap which not yet mapped using ID2D1Bitmap1::Map.

## Possible Fixes

In the same way that ID2D1RenderTarget::EndDraw should follow calls to ID2D1RenderTarget::BeginDraw, ensure that ID2D1Bitmap1::Unmap follows calls to ID2D1Bitmap1::Map. Do not call ID2D1Bitmap1::Unmap multiple times to unmap a bitmap.
