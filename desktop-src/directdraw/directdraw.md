# DirectDraw

This section contains information about programming with the DirectDraw component of the DirectX application programming interface (API).

DirectDraw is no longer recommended for use. With the release of Direct3D 9.0, all two-dimensional functionality is contained within Direct3D, its associated helper functions in D3DX, and the DirectX 11 technology Direct2D. However, the DirectDraw reference documentation is still available in this section.

## In This Section

This section contains the [DirectDraw Reference](directdraw-reference.md) documentation.
