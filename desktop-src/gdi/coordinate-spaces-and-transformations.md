# Coordinate Spaces and Transformations

Applications use coordinate spaces and transformations to scale, rotate, translate, shear, and reflect graphics output. A *coordinate space* is a planar space that locates two-dimensional objects by using two reference axes that are perpendicular to each other. There are four coordinate spaces: world, page, device, and physical device (client area, desktop, or page of printer paper).

A *transformation* is an algorithm that alters ("transforms") the size, orientation, and shape of objects. Transformations also transfer a graphics object from one coordinate space to another. Ultimately, the object appears on the physical device, which is usually a screen or printer.

This chapter is divided into three topics:

-   [About Coordinate Spaces and Transformations](about-coordinate-spaces-and-transformations.md)
-   [Using Coordinate Spaces and Transformations](using-coordinate-spaces-and-transformations.md)
-   [Coordinate Space and Transformation Reference](coordinate-space-and-transformation-reference.md)
