# Device Context Operations

An application can perform the following operations on a device context:

-   Enumerate existing graphic objects.
-   Select new graphic objects.
-   Delete existing graphic objects.
-   Save the current graphic objects, their attributes, and the graphic modes.
-   Restore previously saved graphic objects, their attributes, and the graphic modes.

In addition, an application can use a device context to:

-   Determine how graphics output is translated.
-   Cancel lengthy drawing operations (begun by a thread in a multithreaded application).
-   Reset a printer to a particular state.

This subsection provides information on the following topics.
