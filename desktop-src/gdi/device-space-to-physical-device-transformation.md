# Device-Space to Physical-Device Transformation

The device-space to physical-device transformation is unique in several respects. For example, it is limited to translation and is controlled by the system. The sole purpose of this transformation is to ensure that the origin of device space is mapped to the proper point on the physical device. There are no functions to set this transformation, nor are there any functions to retrieve related data.
