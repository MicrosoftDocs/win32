# About Rectangles

Rectangles are used for the cursor clipping region, the invalid portion of the client area, an area for displaying formatted text, or the scroll area. Your applications can also use rectangles to fill, frame, or invert a portion of the client area with a given brush, and to retrieve the coordinates of a window or a window's client area.
