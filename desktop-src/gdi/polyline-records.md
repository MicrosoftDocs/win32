# Polyline Records

[Polyline](/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-polyline) records are a series of points; lines drawn between the points describe the outline of the character. A polyline record begins with the last point in the previous record (or, for the first record in the contour, the starting point). Each point in the record is on the glyph outline and can be connected simply by using straight lines.
