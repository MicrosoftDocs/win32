# World-Space to Page-Space Transformations

World-space to page-space transformations support translation and scaling. In addition, they support rotation, shear, and reflection capabilities. The following sections describe these transformations, illustrate their effects, and provide the algorithms used to achieve them.

-   [Translation](translation.md)
-   [Scaling](scaling.md)
-   [Rotation](rotation.md)
-   [Shear](shear.md)
-   [Reflection](reflection.md)
-   [Combined World-to-Page Space Transformations](combined-world-to-page-space-transformations.md)
