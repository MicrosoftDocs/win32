# Inverting Regions

An application inverts the colors that appear within a region by calling the [**InvertRgn**](/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-invertrgn) function. On monochrome displays, **InvertRgn** makes white pixels black and black pixels white. On color screens, this inversion is dependent on the type of technology used to generate the colors for the screen.
