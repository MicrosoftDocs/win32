# Pen Width

The width attribute specifies a cosmetic pen width in device units. When used with a geometric pen, however, it specifies the pen's width in logical units. For more information about device units, see [Coordinate Spaces and Transformations](coordinate-spaces-and-transformations.md).

Currently, the system limits the width of cosmetic pens to a single pixel; however, future versions may remove this limitation.
