# ICM-Enabled Pen Functions

Microsoft Image Color Management (ICM) ensures that a color image, graphic, or text object is rendered as close as possible to its original intent on any device, despite differences in imaging technologies and color capabilities among devices. Whether you are scanning an image or other graphic on a color scanner, downloading it over the Internet, viewing or editing it on the screen, or outputting it to paper, film, or other media, ICM version 2.0 helps you keep its colors consistent and accurate. For more information about ICM, see [Windows Color System](/previous-versions//dd372446(v=vs.85))

There are various functions in the graphics device interface (GDI) that use or operate on color data. The following pen functions are enabled for use with ICM:

-   [**CreatePen**](/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-createpen)
-   [**ExtCreatePen**](/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-extcreatepen)
