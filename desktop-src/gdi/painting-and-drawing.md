# Painting and Drawing

This overview describes how the system manages output to the screen and explains what applications must do to draw in a window. In particular, this overview describes *display device contexts* (or, more simply, *display DCs*) and how to prepare and use them. The overview does not explain how to use graphics device interface (GDI) functions to generate output, nor does it explain how to print.
