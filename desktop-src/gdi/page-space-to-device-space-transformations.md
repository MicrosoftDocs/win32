# Page-Space to Device-Space Transformations

The page-space to device-space transformation determines the mapping mode for all graphics output associated with a particular DC. A *mapping mode* is a scaling transformation that specifies the size of the units used for drawing operations. The mapping mode may also perform translation. In some cases, the mapping mode alters the orientation of the x-axis and y-axis in device space. The following topics describe the mapping modes.

-   [Application-Defined Mapping Modes](application-defined-mapping-modes.md)
