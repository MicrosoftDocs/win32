# Device Contexts

A *device context* is a structure that defines a set of graphic objects and their associated attributes, as well as the graphic modes that affect output. The *graphic objects* include a pen for line drawing, a brush for painting and filling, a bitmap for copying or scrolling parts of the screen, a palette for defining the set of available colors, a region for clipping and other operations, and a path for painting and drawing operations. The remainder of this section is divided into the following three areas.

-   [About Device Contexts](about-device-contexts.md)
-   [Using the Device Context Functions](using-the-device-context-functions.md)
-   [Device Context Reference](device-context-reference.md)
