# Pens

A pen is a graphics tool that an application can use to draw lines and curves. Drawing applications use pens to draw freehand lines, straight lines, and curves. Computer-aided design (CAD) applications use pens to draw visible lines, hidden lines, section lines, center lines, and so on. Word processing and desktop publishing applications use pens to draw borders and rules. Spreadsheet applications use pens to designate trends in graphs and to outline bar graphs and pie charts.
