# About Coordinate Spaces and Transformations

Coordinate spaces and transformations are used by the following types of applications:

-   Desktop publishing applications (to "zoom" parts of a page or to display adjacent pages in a window).
-   Computer-aided design (CAD) applications (to rotate objects, scale drawings, or create perspective views).
-   Spreadsheet applications (to move and size graphs).

The following illustrations show successive views of an object created in a drawing application. The first illustration shows the object as it appears in the original drawing; the succeeding five illustrations show the effects of applying various transformations.
