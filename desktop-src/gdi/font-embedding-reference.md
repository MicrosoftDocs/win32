# Font Embedding Reference

The Font Embedding Services Library provides a mechanism to bundle TrueType and Microsoft OpenType fonts into a document or file. Typically, a document containing embedded fonts needs those fonts for rendering the document on another computer. Embedding a font guarantees that a font specified in a file will be present on the computer receiving the file. Some fonts, however, cannot be moved to other computers due to copyright issues limiting distribution.

The following elements are used with Font Embedding Services.
