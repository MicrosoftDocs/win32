# Solid Brush

A *solid brush* is a logical brush that contains 64 pixels of the same color. An application can create a solid logical brush by calling the [**CreateSolidBrush**](/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-createsolidbrush) function, specifying the color of the brush required. After creating the solid brush, the application can select it into its device context and use it to paint filled shapes.
