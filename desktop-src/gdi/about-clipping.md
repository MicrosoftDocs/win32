# About Clipping

Clipping is used by applications in a variety of ways. Word processing and spreadsheet applications clip keyboard input to keep it from appearing in the margins of a page or spreadsheet. Computer-aided design (CAD) and drawing applications clip graphics output to keep it from overwriting the edges of a drawing or picture.

A *clipping region* is a region with edges that are either straight lines or curves. A *clip path* is a region with edges that are straight lines, Bézier curves, or combinations of both. For more information about regions, see [Regions](regions.md). For more information about paths, see [Paths](paths.md).

This overview covers the following topics:

-   [Clipping Regions](clipping-regions.md)
-   [Clip Paths](clip-paths.md)
