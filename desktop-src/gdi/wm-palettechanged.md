# WM\_PALETTECHANGED message

The **WM\_PALETTECHANGED** message is sent to all top-level and overlapped windows after the window with the keyboard focus has realized its logical palette, thereby changing the system palette. This message enables a window that uses a color palette but does not have the keyboard focus to realize its logical palette and update its client area.

A window receives this message through its [**WindowProc**](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms633573(v=vs.85)) function.


```C++
LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProc(
  HWND hwnd, 
  UINT  uMsg, 
  WPARAM wParam, 
  LPARAM lParam    
);
```



## Parameters

<dl> <dt>

*wParam* 
</dt> <dd>

A handle to the window that caused the system palette to change.

</dd> <dt>

*lParam* 
</dt> <dd>

This parameter is not used.

</dd> </dl>

## Remarks

This message must be sent to all top-level and overlapped windows, including the one that changed the system palette. If any child windows use a color palette, this message must be passed on to them as well.

To avoid creating an infinite loop, a window that receives this message must not realize its palette, unless it determines that *wParam* does not contain its own window handle.
