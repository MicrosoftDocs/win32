# Network List Manager

## Purpose

The Network List Manager API enables applications to retrieve a list of available network connections. Applications can filter networks, based on attributes and signatures, and choose the networks best suited to their task. The Network List Manager infrastructure notifies applications of changes in the network environment, thus enabling applications to dynamically update network connections.

## Developer audience

Network List Manager is designed for use by COM programmers.

## Run-time requirements

The Network List Manager API is supported starting with Windows Vista.
