# The Role of Network List Manager

Prior to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, applications were required to call a number of unrelated APIs to obtain data about network attributes such as the IP address, the domain controller, or the Domain Name System (DNS). Starting with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, the Network Location Awareness Winsock API featured a limited set of network location functionality. In Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista, the Network Awareness service captures the network attributes in one location and allows applications to query and retrieve specific networks and attributes. Network List Manager replaces the functionality of the previous Winsock API (available as a Winsock Name Space Provider) while maintaining compatibility with older applications using the Winsock API.
