# Getting Started Developing User Interfaces for Windows Applications

## Purpose

The following sections offer general guidance to developers who are designing, implementing, and testing the user interface of a Windows application.

In addition to basic user interface design principles, numerous recommendations and suggestions are provided that will help developers provide a user experience that is as simple, efficient, and enjoyable as possible.

> [!Note]  
> These guidelines are not intended to be comprehensive and are subject to the specific scope and functionality of an application. For more comprehensive guidelines, see the [Windows User Experience Interaction Guidelines](../uxguide/guidelines.md).
